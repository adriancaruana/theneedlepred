Considering this album's lineup change, its group of new guest singers, Gloss Drop must have been a bit of a challenge for Battles. Also, don't forget to add the fact this thing is the band's Sophomore LP, which comes after a highly praised first album.

If this was a test, Battles passed with flying pink colors. The instrumentation, musicianship, and grooves throughout this album are intense as hell. And guest vocalists like Matias Aguayo and Yamantaka Eye freaking kill it! 

It's one of the most weird and fun and weird and fun and weird and fun and weird and fun albums you'll hear this year.

What should I review next, eh? What do you think of this album, too? Hate it? Love it? Why, oh, why?
