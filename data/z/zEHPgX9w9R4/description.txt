France's Herman Dune has come correct with another batch of light, breezy indie folk tunes that make for a perfect summer listen. Like always, the band's frontman, David, brings these songs to live with his approachable voice and personality. 

To me, some songs really do pale in comparison to others, but albums with this kind of personality have always tended to wear thin with me a little bit. I bring this duo up because I think a lot of y'all might appreciate it more than I am.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? What should I review next, eh?
