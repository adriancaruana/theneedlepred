Mike Patton and company make Oddfellows a step back toward their experimental and alternative rock sound, abandoning the Native American music influences that made Anonymous such a strangely spicy album. However, it's still a pretty odd, catchy collection of tracks--with a few undeniable potholes, unfortunately.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
