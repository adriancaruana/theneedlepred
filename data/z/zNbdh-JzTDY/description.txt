2. Holy Ghost! video: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=4528

On this new single, UK electronic artist Jamie Woon wanders solemnly, carrying a style of dubstep with him that isn't unlike Burial's--in fact, Burial co-produced this track, so there ya go.

And while this style of music is known for its minimal, cleanly sound, this sounds just a little too safe for me pull anything all that interesting from it. Combined with the lyricism, vocals, and straightforward song structure here, "Night Air" just leaves an awkward taste sitting in my ears.

While this might appeal to those who are enjoying this new world of dubstep, or the latest string of artists to experiment with modern R&B, it's just not for me, I think. A little too reserved, a little too plain, I guess.

What do you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? What should I review next?

5/10
