Deftones make a lighter and more ethereal left turn with their latest album, much like they did with Saturday Night Wrist in 2006, but the end result is nowhere near as experimental or expansive, unfortunately. Though much of the songwriting is enjoyable here, for this most part, this album feels like Deftones are playing it a little safe.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
