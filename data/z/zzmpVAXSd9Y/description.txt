T,TC's latest single goes down the same dark road we saw him on in Bastard. His flow and rhymes are better than ever, but I'm still hesitant to jump into the foxhole and start fighting for the future of Odd Future. 

There's a ton of potential bubbling under this project. I'm enjoying it, but to say it's exploding right now would be kinda premature. It can go in a lotta directions from here.

What do you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
