My bro JCDSOUND also review'd this LP:

Coming in second only to Little Women's Throat, this album is the most abusive thing I've heard all year. It's pure, unadulterated testosterone. It's the kinda stuff that makes a perfect soundtrack to taking your shirt off and punching anything and everything withing arm's length. 

Over the course of this LP's 10 tracks, the band alternates ideas from hardcore, thrash, and grind. The breakdowns fit snugly against the flurries of drums and grinding guitar, too. 

I know I've given this a high score, but still want to say this album is not for everyone. It's only going to attract a very specific music fan: Someone who looks to put some real volume and intensity in their speakers. This thing isn't light-hearted or friendly by any means. If tooth-gnashing aggression is not what you want, then stay away from this thing. Far away.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?
