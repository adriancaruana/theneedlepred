Chromeo's third album is their sweetest set of sounds yet. The heavy synths and disco rhythms make this thing instant and undeniable. Anyone who prefers their music with a dance beat will take to this pretty easily.

Though is does get cheesy at times, it's all part of the appeal. It's slick, cool, and well-dressed album. Though it's not the deepest thing to be released this year, it's not trying to be. 

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Is dance music shite? Is there not enough of it? Does this album bring disco and funk back to life? Is Chromeo saving music?
