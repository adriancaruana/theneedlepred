Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire's Kismet is definitely a bounce back from the New York rapper's last project, which was a little too inconsistent. He brings plenty of topical tracks with grimy beats on this thing. His deep, somewhat goofy voice adds some character to these tracks, too.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
