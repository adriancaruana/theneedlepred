If this song is any indication of what we can expect from the National's upcoming LP, High Violet, then we're in for a more grandiose version of what this band has always done. It seems the Nat is infinitely content with being one of the most unaffected rock groups out there, which may not thrill some people, but the lush production on this track is a nice touch. With bands this consistent, the worry of remaking the same record over again is always a worry, but maybe that's just me. I guess we'll never have to worry about these guys going Creed on us, eh.

The band sounds like the same group of guys who made Boxer the fantastic record it is, and with any luck this release will be equally stunning.
