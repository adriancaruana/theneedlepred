Lyrics: http://rapgenius.com/albums/J-cole/Cole-world-sideline-story

On his first official full-length album on Roc Nation, rapper and producer J. Cole takes the talents he's been perfecting on past mixtapes and goes big time with them.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?

6/10
