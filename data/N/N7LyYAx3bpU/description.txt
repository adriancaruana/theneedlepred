Swans' new LP is a welcomed return of the New York band. But it's hard for me to see the group as something more than just a beefier version of frontman Michael Gira's solo work up to this point.

I believe Gira wants to legitimately bring the band back, and I wish him luck. I think with another LP, it's the rockier moments that will come off stronger than the acoustic ones. Because as of this point, the latter is the more memorable on this LP.

What do you think of this release? Loving it? Hating it? Why?
