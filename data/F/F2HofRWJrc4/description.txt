Flying Lotus' new EP is a morning snack to chomp on after the long night one might pull digesting Cosmogramma in its entirety. Even in small doses, Fly Lo makes sure there's a ton of sound to go around; building his unique beats with unusual synths and percussion. Every track on this thing is worth exploring. It's not an amazing release, but a must for the fans. 

Newbs should start with any of his three LPs--preferably Los Angeles. 

What do you think of this EP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What do you think of Fly Lo's work? What's your favorite Fly Lo track? Is there where hip hop is headed?
