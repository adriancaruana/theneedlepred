Cult of Luna's latest effort sees the Swedish atmospheric sludge outfit maintaining its sound with mid-paced tempos and heavy guitars, but the songwriting seems to have lost a disappointing amount of detail and diversity.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
