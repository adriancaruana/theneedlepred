Schoolboy Q might not be an amazing lyricist, and his new album might have a handful of filler hooks, but Oxymoron also shows him riding a variety of beats with an impressive level of precision. Not only that, but a number of tracks here bring back the grit and vulgarity of 90s gangsta rap, and give it a progressive instrumental backdrop.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

This video is a reupload that fixed a messed up album cover and misinformation dealing in what year Habits & Contradictions came out.

I've also been confused about the various versions of this album.
