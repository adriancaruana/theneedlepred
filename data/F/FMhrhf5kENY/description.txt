On her sophomore album, Chelsea Wolfe brings together ten pieces of straight up darkness. But what makes the dreary, depressing feelings on this album so palatable is that Wolfe attacks this darkness from multiple angles with noise rock guitars, doom metal riffs, ambient soundscapes, smooth beats, and blood-curdling snarls.

While all the songs head roughly in the same direction, they find various ways to do it without adding up to an album that feels disjointed or scatterbrained.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
