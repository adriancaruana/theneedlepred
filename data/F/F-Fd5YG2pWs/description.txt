Squarepusher has taken on a whole new job on this new album. Technically, it's really the album of Shobaleader One, which is the name of the project Squarepusher is leading here. As usually, Jenkinson stirs up some surprising sounds and directions. He always keeps his fans guessing, and this is no exception. I like some of the songs here, but what's keeping me from loving the album is its tinny sound and its awkward mix. The robotic vocals are much louder than anything else on half of these songs, and the bass and guitars are way too processed. It's a great effort, and I expect better things in the future. I haven't given up on this idea. I just think the dust needs to settle a bit more on it.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?
