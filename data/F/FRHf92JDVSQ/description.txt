West Coast screamo outfit Touché Amoré's third record is easily the most ambitious in their discography so far, featuring some incredibly dynamic and melodic punk guitars and lyrics that dive into the depths of mortality, legacy, and the band itself.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
