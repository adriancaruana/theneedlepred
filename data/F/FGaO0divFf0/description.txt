When it comes to black metal, Vreid's V is as melodic and thrashy as they come. It's actually difficult to simply call it a black metal album.

The production is fantastic, and the musicianship is impressive during a lot of the solos, too. The issue I'm having with the album, though, is that it's not organized very cohesively, considering so many instrumental interludes basically hijack the songs until they're bordering on being directionless.

Sure, you could chalk it up to unconventional song structures, but I can't help but feel like I'm dealing with something different. This is no Agalloch we're talking about here.

Overall, I liked it. I'm basically talking about it because I think maybe some of you will like it more than me.

What do you think of this music? Do you love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
