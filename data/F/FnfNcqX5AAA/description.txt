Radiohead's latest LP is a fan-pleasing piece of work. It's loaded with beautiful and well-recorded sounds, and even Thom Yorke's songwriting shows some muscle with moments like "Lotus Flower" and "Separator." 

But there's something that clicks away and eats away at the first half of this album, in my opinion. Though I like what I'm hearing, I can't say I'm enjoying how it's organized. It kinda sounds like the beat arrangements were produced on a "ctrl + c / ctrl + v" basis. 

The second half of this album is a bit of a different story, though. "Give Up the Ghost" and "Codex" are a really nice break from the beats, but I can't help but feel a little underwhelmed by what's going on here. Nothing here hit me with the emotional impact of earlier albums.

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why? How does this Radiohead album sit with you? How does it compare to others?

6/10
