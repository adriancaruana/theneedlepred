Asobi Seksu's first leak from their forthcoming album is a surprising break from the pop song structure they usually follow. 

Distorted and dissonant guitars cycle into one another in the background as Yuki spills a pretty impressive vocal delivery all over the mix. The track develops one idea into another, and fails to repeat much of anything. It's a risk. With no apparent hook, the track could have resulted in something forgettable, but it's way too dramatic to be anything less than impressive.

I'm not so in love with the track I'm gonna be playing it endlessly, but I'm gonna love the new Seksu album is all the songs are this winding and melodic.

What did you think of this song? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?

7/10
