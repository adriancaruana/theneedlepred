Vektor's latest album continues further down the road the Arizona band set for itself on 2009's Black Future. It's certainly a more dynamic and melodic release, but I was ultimately hoping for a stronger difference between this album and its predecessor. Still, these tunes embrace Vektor's usual sound without feeling stale.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
