On Anika's debut LP, the English singer and Portishead's Geoff Barrow bring six covers and two originals through a post-punk and dub transformation. The album's sound is extremely interesting, showcasing Barrow's knack for channeling this particular era of music. However, Anika's vocals don't bring a lot to the table; plus, a lot of the instrumentation just seems thrown together.

I realize there are lot of mistakes and flubs left in here for effect, but deciding when or where this practice is actually interesting is a real gray area. I know there are plenty of mistake-filled records I've enjoyed in the past, but this just isn't one of them.

What do you think? Did you enjoy this album? Hate it? Why?

3/10
