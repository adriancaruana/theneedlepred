In comparison to their debut album, this EP is a real letdown for me. The weird personality and eccentricity seem to have melted away--or at least get a cover-up from all the new instrumentation on these tracks.

Many will say this release is a more mature direction, and that may be true; however, maturity isn't what brought me to the table in the first place. Album was an extremely fun release. It's quirks, experimental production, and strong pop hooks are what brought me into the fold; not pedal steel solos and forced drama.

There are some great songs on here, but there are too many moments and melodies recycled from the full-length debut to really go insane over the songwriting.

I realize many EPs are merely transitional periods for some bands, and I'm willing to accept that in this case. I'll be ready and waiting for the new Girls album when it drops, and I'm confident at least some of what made girls distinct to me will resurface.

What did you think of this EP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
