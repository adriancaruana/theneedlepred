The new All Pigs Must Die EP is an aggressive display of metallic hardcore. Though it's not the most unique set of tracks in the world, it's still hard-hitting and performed really well. Plus, Converge's Kurt Ballou pulls together a great sound on the production end of things.

What do you think of this EP? Love it? Hate it? Why?

7/10
