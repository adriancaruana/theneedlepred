Braids' debut LP is a fun exercise in trippy, electronic psychedelia. The vocal and drum mixing and recording could have been a lot better, but the rest of this album is too good to deny. 

The pulsating synths bounce from one wall to another, the song lengths sprawl out into near endlessness, and the mood ranges from upbeat to dreamy without losing any momentum.

I wouldn't call it an amazing listen, but it's certainly interesting and engaging throughout. Considering this album is a huge improvement upon their previously released Set Pieces EP, I can't wait to see what changes the band makes when they put out something else!

What do you think of this LP? Awesome? Not so awesome? Why? What should I review next?

7/10
