Cut Copy's new single has me curious about their upcoming album. Will the rest of it sound like this? The sound of "Where I'm Going" is a far cry from their electropop stuff on previous releases. It's cool to see the band pursue a more classic sound, but I'm hoping they put a more original spin on it come 2011.

What did you guys think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Hrrmrmrmmrmr?

The 'forever' came from http://www.youtube.com/user/dislikeusername. What a great guy! Can you say 'forever' on camera and post it as a video response? Creativity gets extra points!
