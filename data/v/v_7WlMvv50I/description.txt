The Dead Weather's latest LP is a deep exploration into eleven shades of badass blues rock. Jack White brings some great guitar sounds so the mix, and overall the production is just top-notch. My one issue is with the vocals and vocal deliveries. It sounds almost as if White and Moss are trying too hard to have soul, I'm not sure. I've heard White sound a lot more natural on his previous efforts, and wish that same feel came across on this album, too. I figure my issue with the vocals will probably be some tick that I'm only feeling, heh. Maybe I'm crazy.

What do you think of this album? Do you love it? Hate it? Is it better or worse than Horehound? Remember that band "the White Stripes"? Yeah, they were cool.
