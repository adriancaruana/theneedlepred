4 years after Beach Fossils' great sophomore album Clash the Truth, the Brooklyn band has returned with their most lavish effort yet. I can still commend the band for not shamelessly trend-chasing like many of their dreamy, jangly contemporaries, but unfortunately the pastiche of '60s pop sounds they serve up here isn't enough to distract from some pretty bland songwriting.
