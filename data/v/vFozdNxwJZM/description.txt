On their second album, Foals concentrate their sound on something a lot more reserved and straightforward. Any slight weirdness found on their debut full length is out to lunch when it comes to Total Life Forever, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. A really chill mood pervades this entire release, but much of the time I find myself wanting more. I wish this thing took a few more chances; however, I still have to give huge props to the musicianship and the crisp, clean production. 

Is it an awful album that you should steer clear of? No. It's simply not my cup of tea is all. Foals are very passionate about what they do on this album, but that doesn't mean I'm going to like it, but I would recommend this for anyone looking for some tight, danceable indie rock.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? I'm especially curious to hear why you may like it!!!!!
