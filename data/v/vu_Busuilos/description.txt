On their debut LP, Niki & the Dove draw up some really catchy synth pop tunes, but fail to draw up their own take on the style. However, it still ends up being a reasonably enjoyable record based solely on the merits of their production and hooks.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
