Aleph has some pretty hard-hitting tech house highlights, but most of the subdued tracks just simply aren't as engaging, and only seem like they exist to balance out the aggressive moments here--a lot of which sound very similar.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
