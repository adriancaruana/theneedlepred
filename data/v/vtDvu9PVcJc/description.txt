JGCSOUND's review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gqqILdRcZ4

Ghost's debut LP, Opus Eponymous, is finally getting released in the US after gaining a lot of buzz across the pond in Europe. These guys play a style of metal that buffet picks different sounds genre's roots. It sounds kinda retro without directly referencing one single band, and I think that's where the real success is. It's like they've been able to go back in time and hammer out a nice for themselves in what already seemed to be a crowded area.

The lyrics are very cultist and satanic, but still catchy. The slightly deadpan vocals only make the sound eerier--along with the sinister organ, of course.

Aside from some abrupt fades and endings, I don't have many complaints here. It could be a little longer, but the songs are still strong and mighty! 

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? What should I review next?
