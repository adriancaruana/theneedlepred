On James Blake's latest album, the various sides to his musical personality blend together into a pretty uniform set of tracks that combine detailed electronica, chorus-based songwriting, piano, and Blake's sharp voice.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
