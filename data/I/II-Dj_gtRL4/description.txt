Crystal Castles latest album isn't exactly a reinvention of the electronic duo. I can't say they've gone v2.0 on us. Maybe it's more like a v1.4. Many of the tracks sound similar to those on the first album, but the ones that don't are more than interesting. For the most part, the album is a pretty chilly, reserved experience, saving most of its aggression for the track "Doe Deer." Not amazing, but a somewhat decent followup to the first album, which I freaking went gaga over the first time I heard it. 

What did you think of this album? Love It? Hate it? Why?

7/10
