I've been on the fence about many albums this year, but this is one of the few where I'm torn. For every great moment on the new Arcade Fire record, there's one that falls incredibly short of whatever stylistic mark the band was shooting for. Rather than deliver another cohesive set of songs, Reflektor embarks upon a stylistic hodgepodge full of hits and misses. 

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
