Thee Silver Mount Zion's latest record is the Montreal band's heaviest and noisiest yet, It's not just a mess of abrasive sounds, though. There's plenty of fantastic string arrangements and moving lyrics to be had on these tracks, too.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
