On Foals' third full-length album, the UK rock band continues down the path they set for themselves on 2010's Total Life Forever, favoring newfound maturity over the raw energy that made the band so exciting in the first place.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
