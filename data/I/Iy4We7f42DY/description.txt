Though Mature Themes does contain some of my favorite Ariel Pink songs, it's hardly a solid listen. Between "Nostradamus & Me" and "Driftwood," there are just too many underwhelming and forgettable potholes on this LP. 

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
