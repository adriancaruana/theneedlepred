The War On Drugs' Slave Ambient is a glistening set of folk rock tunes and kinda ambient instrumentals. The production, for me, is a real blessing on this LP. The sounds are so pretty, which actually makes me wanna revisit a great deal of these tracks.

But as far as songwriting and vocal deliveries go, the nail isn't hit on the head every single time. Plus, a good chunk of these songs either feel too alike other tracks on this album. I'd even go as far as saying there's a bit of filler on here.

Still, there are more good moments than bad with Slave Ambient, which makes the War On Drugs a project worth watching closely.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
