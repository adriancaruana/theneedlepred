On his sophomore album, Schoolboy Q chases after a number of different sounds and personalities. For me, it's kinda hit-or-miss, but there are still tracks on here that make it worthwhile to visit this album at least once.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
