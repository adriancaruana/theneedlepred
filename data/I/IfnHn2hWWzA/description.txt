Wasting Light is easily one of Foo Fighters' most consistent effort in their past several albums, but it's not resonating with me like I wanted it to. Chalk it up to the album just not being my style, I suppose.

Still, I can appreciate a great studio sound when I hear one. The guitars here are thick and gratifying in a way that reminds me of some great Queens of the Stone Age tunes. Some of the harder tracks here--like "White Limo" remind me of moments from the Foos' first album!

Still, there's a bit of an arena rock flavor on this LP that seems a little out of character. It's not bad, but not exactly a return to form either. I'd be alright with it if it weren't for the relentlessly generic lyricism. I understand the topics music touches on can be a little cliche, but layering that with phrases like "you and what army" and "it's alright" only make things worse--not to mention it subtracts some authenticity points.

Overall, it's not a bad album. I enjoyed it while it was on, but don't expect to find gold if you're digging for a deeper meaning here. Only a few tracks are good for that. This thing is more appropriate for a loud and heavy rock out session on top of the couch with your favorite bandana and air guitar, for sure.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?

6/10
