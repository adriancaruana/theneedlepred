New York outfit rap outfit Das Racist is equal parts intelligent and absurd. Even at their most comedic, both of these mixtapes are reinforced with a thin layer of social critique. But when things get serious, well, things really don't get all that serious. 

While Shut Up, Dude doesn't have the consistency of Sit Down, Man, both are extremely fun and fresh rap releases. It's music that doesn't care what anyone things. I've always been the type of person to gravitate toward that personality. If you're the same, then jump on the bandwagon.

What do you think of these mixtapes? Love 'em? Hate 'em? Why?
