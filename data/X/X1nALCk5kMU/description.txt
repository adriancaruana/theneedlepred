A-1's latest mixtape conceptually incorporates samples of numerous 90s television show themes. From the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers to Doug, the nostalgia hits pretty hard. As far as rhymes go, A-1 is on the ball. He's got a great flow, philosophy, and personality. He's not up to the level of a sensei yet, but he sounds hungry enough to get there eventually.

What do you think of this mixtape? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, y'all? *hugs* Thanks for being awesome.
