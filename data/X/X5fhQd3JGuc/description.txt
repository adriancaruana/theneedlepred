If heavy percussion and endless grooves are where your eargasms come from, then the latest compilation from Analog Africa will not, I repeat, will not disappoint. Between fifteen tracks and a dozen different bands, this thing is a real triumph. It suffers from a bit of sameness, but what compilation doesn't? That still doesn't change the fact that these songs are serious musical relics. Get down and be groovy.

I know we talked a lot about summer records, but this is MY summer record.
