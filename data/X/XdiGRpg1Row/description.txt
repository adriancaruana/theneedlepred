Mac Miller's followup to Blue Slide Park is an improvement on all fronts. While it's not gonna be one of my favs for the year, Mac is seriously reaching for the potential that I've felt he's had for a while with creative production choices, better flows, and some impressive features.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
