On Arcade Fire's latest album, they take the most ambitious and immediate elements of their previous albums, and feed them into americana-style songwriting. Standing at an hour, it's a long freaking album, and it's thematic, too. If you're a fan of AF, this album won't be a surprise, and should prove to be a real show of growth.
