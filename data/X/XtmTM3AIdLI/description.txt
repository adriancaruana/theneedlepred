On Fergus & Geronimo's debut LP, the Texas duo tries their hand at doo wop, powerpop, and oddball garage tunes. Shockingly, they do it all pretty well.

Even though it's not stylistically consistent or extremely ambitious, F&G's wit and humor comes out in nearly every song, which is really what makes these tracks shine.

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why?
