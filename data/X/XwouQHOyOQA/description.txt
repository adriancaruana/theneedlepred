Despite this being the commercial debut of this New York hip hop duo, the Underachievers are sounding a bit rougher than they did on their breakthrough tape Indigoism.

FAV TRACKS: LUMINESCENCE, CAPRICE, INCANDESCENT, METROPOLIS, FELICITY, AMORPHOUS

LEAST FAV TRACK: ETHEREAL, and, yes, I know that I got a shoutout on this track. I dug the verses on this song, for the most part. What I didn't dig was how buried the beat felt in respect to the vocals. It was a bit of weird mixing, to me. 

THE UNDERACHIEVERS - CELLAR DOOR: TERMINUS UT EXORDIUM / 2014 / RPM MSC / HARDCORE HIP HOP, ABSTRACT HIP HOP, 3RD EYE SHIT, PSYCHEDELIC HIP HOP, TRIPPY TRAP, EAST COAST HIP HOP
