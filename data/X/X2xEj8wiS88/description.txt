On this new Interpol track, the band goes in a linear direction, soundtracked by atmospheric guitars and some gripping vocals by Paul Banks. Unfortunately, when the band ends the song, they find themselves in the middle of nowhere without much to show for it. Some great moments here, but kinda underwhelming in the end.
