Holy Ghost!'s debut LP is buff with great sounds, songs, and production value. This is not some soggy, lo-fi set of dance tracks you'd find for free on the internet somewhere. This is a crisp, lush barrage of beats and hooks.

This LP is on DFA Records, and Holy Ghost! is currently holding the torch when it comes to the label's reputation for great alternative dance music.

A lotta the hooks and melodies here stuck with me instantly, but the game this band plays has been played before--but arguably, no one is yet to play it this well in 2011. 

While I've heard this style before, it hasn't stopped me from enjoying this at all. If there's a great song behind the aesthetic, there's no reason to get hung up.

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
