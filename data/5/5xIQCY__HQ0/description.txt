Broken Social Scene's 4th album has been getting quite a bit of buzz, but I can't help but feel like it's a little generic. I found their previous albums much more engaging, adventurous, and distinct. Though it's tough to nail BSS down due to their plethora of different styles, these previous releases at least had some semblance of originality. This album seems content to take absolutely no chances, and touts some pretty subtlety-smothering mixing. No reason to give up on BSS entirely, but I can't say I'm going to spend any more time on this album this year.

What do you think of this LP? Love it?  Hate it? Why?
