Miami Horror's new album didn't amaze me, but it's an undeniably definitive look at dance music's current obsession with mixing disco and house. There are some noteworthy vocal collaborations, and some great songs on the LP, too. It starts strong and ends strong with a few slow and underwhelming spots along the way. It got a little generic here and there, but no complaints other than that.

What did you think of this album? What do you think of dance music these days, in general? Do you like dance music at all? Should this have been a metal review?
