Crazy Beastie Boys trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBa5qp9sUOY

On their latest single, the Beastie Boys bring back their classic sound without coming off dated. I love the detail in this boom-bap beat. It doesn't get much more crisp than this. With crowd sounds, a few interludes, some DJ cuts, and a robot voice, there's a lot of detail to be had in this one. 

Though I don't feel like the guys bring their best lyrics on this one, their interplay has gotten better with age. There's no denying that these guys work best as a unit. The whole is much greater than the sum of its parts here.

Though I wasn't a fan of 5 Boroughs, I'm hoping that album only proves to be a misstep, and not some fall from grace. Because to me, the 'Boys have as much energy here as they had on Hello Nasty. If they keep that up for an entire record, we could have another solid release to add to the group's discog.

What do you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Excited for the release of this new album? Why? Why not? Do you think the Beastie Boys are too old? Too Young? Just the perfect age? Is rap a young man's game?
