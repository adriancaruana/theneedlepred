Cut Copy's latest album is sweet, danceable, and good-natured. There's no denying that. But the personality on this album--or lack of it, really--is what prevents this album from sticking with me. The vocal melodies and lyrics are pretty underwhelming, and the grooves don't hit as hard as they could.

I'm not surprised this band is as popular as they are. They've got a clean and pleasant delivery; plus, their music is in league with a currently popular retro synthpop sound. But there's not much about this album that gets me truly, truly excited.

What do you think about this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
