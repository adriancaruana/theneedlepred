WU LYF's debut album rides in on a tidal wave of reverb and eccentric yelps from the band's lead singer. While it does have a uniform sound and a style, I feel like the style drowns out what this band has to offer in this songs most of the time. The echoes make their instruments bounce off one another in a wild mess that's more disorienting than interesting.

I like the ingredients, but the batter tastes a little off to me, I guess.

What are you feeling on this album? Loving it? Hating it? Why? What should I review next?

5/10
