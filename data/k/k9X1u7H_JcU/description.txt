of Montreal's latest record sees the band stripping things back to some pretty base instrumentation, resulting in a sound that's pretty similar to the band's early work. However, Kevin Barnes proves he's still a pretty manic songwriter, consistently delivering wordy, witty, and intense lyrics in his trademark vocals.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
