After about eight years of silence, Boards of Canada return with Tomorrow's Harvest, which might be their saddest and most desolate record to date; directly emulating much of the progressive synth and soundtrack music that has always informed the duo's style.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
