Neil Young's latest LP is certainly heavy with effects and guitar distortion, but it doesn't hold my interest with the same power the heavy hitters in drone and doom do. There are some great songwriting moments on here, but the production just doesn't take things far enough. Though Neil sounds like he's swimming in a sea of noise, it doesn't come out that noisy on the listener's end. I want to be in le noise, too. Why should Neil get to have all the fun?

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why?

5/10
