The Kurt Ballou-produced debut album of Norway's Kvelertak is a powerful piece of metal music. I heard about it last year on metalsucks.net, but refrained from commenting since there would be no way of picking up the album locally.

But now that this album should be getting a physical release in the US this March, I'm happy to talk about its amazing blend of rock 'n' roll and black metal--not to mention the sludgy, heavy production.

Some moments on this LP blend together for me, but it's still high-quality entertainment, build on good songwriting, mighty riffs, righteous guitar leads, and harsh vocals. It's as melodic as it is aggressive, and as accessible as it is heavy.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
