James Blake's new EP, much like his self-titled debut earlier this year, is loaded with ideas that, to me, don't feel completely finished. Still, the guy draws up some interesting concepts--even as he attempts to focus more on building songs on voice and piano this time around.

What do you think of this EP, eh? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
