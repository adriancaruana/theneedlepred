This album is Burzum's 7th studio album, and Varg Vikernes' return to releasing music. His last album was released in 1999, and was recorded while in jail. Of course, Varg's two jailtime LPs went in a much more ambient direction, Belus is a comparative shock. This album is loud, harsh, and distorted as the flaming, demon-filled pits of hell. Though we expect black metal to have a lo-fi sound, the massive amount of guitar on this album has to be due to some lackluster production. Burzum's previous LPs are much less repetitive and have a better sonic balance--even though they're comprised of lo-fi recordings, too. Though it's cool to see that Varg is getting back into the saddle, I can't say this is all that exciting or interesting as a standalone piece of music. Varg's infamous reputation is fueling a lot of hype around this album, but the music simply fails to live up to it.

4/10
