James Blake's debut album is loaded with gorgeous layers of synthesizers, beats, samples, and crooning vocals. When it comes to creating a series a pretty sounds, this guy's album spins like gold. 

There's more good than bad happening on this LP, certainly, but some moments here come of a little undercooked or short-winded when compared to heavyweights like "Wilhelms Scream" and "Limit To Your Love."

Besides, I've always been a little iffy on albums whose best--or second best--track is a cover.

In the end, this is another decent full-length debut from a fresh face. Blake could give his contemporaries a real run for their money in the future, but I'm sure many a reviewer will tell you he already is.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?

7/10
