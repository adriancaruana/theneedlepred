On Coma Cinema's third album lo-fi production backs up some real-life sadness on about 15 songs. It's a little spotty, but nothing really sticks around long enough to disappoint. Some songs here really did hit me as memorable on my first listen, though.

If you're down with the sounds of Simon Joyner and Elliott Smith, it's worth a try. Mat Cothran is definitely on his way to something impressive.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? What should I review next, eh?
