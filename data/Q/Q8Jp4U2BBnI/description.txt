On Wavves' latest album, singer-songwriter Nathan Williams teams up with the late Jay Reatard's old rhythm section to assemble twelve summer rock anthems. This LP should tickle fans of all this noise rock and pop floating about the blog-o-sphere these days from acts like No Age and Vivian Girls. However, there's a huge pop/skate punk influence informing these songs, too: The Queers, the Mr. T Experience, Screeching Weasel.

Just rock to this thing and let me know how you feel. Who cares who Wavves is? Who cares about the drama, bullshit, and news items that have come up over the past year or so? If it's decent music, it's decent music, and I feel it is.

What do you think about this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why?
