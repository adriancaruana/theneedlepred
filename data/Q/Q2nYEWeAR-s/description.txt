On their third LP, Wolf Parade pull together their most cohesive sound yet. The differences that separated the band's two main songwriters, Dan Boeckner and Spencer Krug, are slowly disappearing. The loud, voluminous production on this release makes for a highly visceral experience, but Dan fits into this mold much easier than Spencer does. It's the most no nonsense this band has ever been, but they've dampened their idiosyncrasies a bit in the process.

This is still an admirable record, though, and one hardcore fans are probably going to enjoy more than me. But what do you think of this album?
