On Wire's twelfth studio album, the band embraces the minimalism and simple pop hooks that make their post-Pink Flag albums so appealing.

The problem is that some of the songs feel a little off, and the production is no walk in the park. Colin Newman lays chorus effects on his vocals throughout the whole album, and the extreme amounts of compression on this LP make some of the tracks here sound like overmodulated crap.

I could see some moments on this album growing on me, but not by much.

What do you think of this album? What do you think of Wire? Do you love this band? Hate 'em? Why? What's up with minimalism? What's up with post-punk? What's up with 12 studio albums? What should I review next?
