The new Cass McCombs album, though I did find it to be a little middle-of-the-road, is a nice change of pace for this singer-songwriter. A good handful of the songs here have a harder rock edge to 'em, and some pretty interesting stories laced into the lyrics.

What do you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

6/10
