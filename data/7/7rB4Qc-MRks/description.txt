On their first official album release, THEESatisfaction alternate between the sounds of neo-soul, abstract hip hop, jazz, funk, and more. While the combination of genres is refreshing, the bold and out-there personality of this record is what ends up making it attractive.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
