Sleepy Sun's sophomore LP has got the ambition, musicianship, and emasculate production timeless rock records are built on. This release has some really strong songs, burning melodies, memorable solos; there's just a lot going for it, to be frank. I didn't care for the sedate vocals one hundred percent of the time, but that's a matter of personal taste I can easily look past when a record is this good.

What do you think of this album? Have you heard it? You should! if you have, do you love it? Hate it? Why?
