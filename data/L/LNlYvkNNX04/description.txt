This sophomore album from The Tallest Man On Earth is an unbelievably fresh look at folk music. This album is built from the earth, but doesn't feel archaic like something from the heydays of Woody Guthrie or Leadbelly. This thing doesn't even feel as old as America's folk revival in the 60s. Though there is some obvious Bob Dylan influence going on here, I'm sure The Tallest is equally conscious of his contemporaries like Neil Young, Phil Ochs, or Townes Van Zandt. 

Poetic lyrics, picturesque descriptions, great guitar work, and strong songwriting. Not much here in terms of a new or innovative sound, but that's completely unnecessary in this instance. Check this one out, guys.
