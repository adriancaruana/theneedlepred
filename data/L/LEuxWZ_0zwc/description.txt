On their first full-length collaboration, Madlib and Guilty Simpson come up with some pretty stunning moments; showing these guys might be a match made in heaven. However, the chance to really observe these two at their best doesn't really happen here. Even this album's best songs feeling weighted down by the enormous amount of filler on this LP. About half of this album is made of intros, preludes, outros, interludes, and intermissions. Many of these transition tracks are longer than the songs themselves, which is kinda depressing. If this thing were split up into an EP, it would be a much stronger release; because at this point, OJ Simpson takes way too many breaks to keep up the fantastic momentum some of these songs bring.

What do you think of this album? How would you score it?
