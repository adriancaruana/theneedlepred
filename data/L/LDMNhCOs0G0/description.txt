Experimental hip hop and electronic music producer CX KiDTRONiK's KRACK ATTACK 2 will probably be one of the noisiest and most high-octane experiences you'll have with music this year--even if it is a bit messy and inconsistent.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
