Deerhunter's latest LP is easily one of their most immediate. It's not as loud as Microcastle's more abrasive points, but doesn't get nearly as quiet either.

Instead, this album sounds more like a full, fleshed out version of what frontman Bradford Cox was shooting for on his last solo LP, Logos. There's more acoustic guitar here, and the songwriting steals the spotlight more than ever--but without abandoning Deerhunter's signature set of psychedelic sounds and effects.

More albums like this, and Deerhunter will have quite the legacy going for them in 10 years.
