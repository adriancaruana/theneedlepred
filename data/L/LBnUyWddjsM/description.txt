With his fourth full-length album, Flying Lotus returns from his psychedelic and spacious trip into jazz with Cosmogramma, and decides to bring things back down to earth with an album that feels a bit smoother on the ears.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
