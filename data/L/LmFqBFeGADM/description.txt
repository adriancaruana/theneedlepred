While it is exciting for me to be hearing singer-songwriter Spencer Krug fronting a band once again on the latest album to come out of his Moonface project, this album, for many reasons, didn't measure up to my expectations.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
