Sunn O))) & Ulver come together for a collaborative album whose recording process has been ongoing since 2008. Despite the short length of this thing, Terrestrials shows a balanced fusion of each artist's sound.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
