This latest Porns record might not be their most consistent, but it's clearly their most orchestrated. This thing has a plethora of instrumentation and strong-as-hell songwriting. The Bejar songs are seductive, and the Case songs are catchy. They could have let up on the group singing, though. Great pop hooks, and very few complaints. Light & sweet, my friends, light & sweet.
