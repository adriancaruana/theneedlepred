On his latest EP, Sufjan Stevens is sounding as ambitious as ever. The arrangements throughout this album complement the songs on an unbelievable level. It's almost as if the songs couldn't possibly survive without them.

The usual orchestra beauty Stevens specializes in is here, but some classic rock flavors are found on this release, too. Some very Pink Floyd-esque jams make a few moments here really special. 

I'm officially converted.
