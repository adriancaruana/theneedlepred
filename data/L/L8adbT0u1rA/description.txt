New York's Cerebral Ballzy have a lot of energy and rage, but I still don't know what exactly is causing all of it. It's just my opinion, but I didn't find much to get enraged over in the lyrics on this album. Being told where to pee should be the least of society's worries.

There are bellyaches aimed toward cops and authority on this album, but the fish these songs do fry are small ones. There's nothing that boldly points at things like corruption or even police brutality. The lyrics just cry out against the same restrictions a parent might put on a toddler. If Cerebral Ballzy had a rap sheet, I'd guess it would be filled mostly with counts of loitering, vandalism, and petty theft. 

Aside from the thrashy riffs and great production, I guess I don't see a lot of purpose in this record. I know that's a very personal thing, but what reviews of mine aren't simply just my personal view.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?

3/10
