On Toxic Holocaust's fourth album, the Portland band takes a leaner approach to its grimy fusion of punk and thrash metal, lowering the black metal influences that were once prominent on the band's earlier releases.

While there's not a lot of variety to be had on this release, it's not something I really ask for from this album. It's quick, 33-minute shot of rough riffs and tooth-gnashing ferocity.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

My Man JGCSound reviewed this LP, too. Here's his channel:
