The Wild Hunt review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNlYvkNNX04

Even shortly after the release of his previous after, the Tallest Man fails to disappoint or sound winded. Kristian Matsson fingerpicks and strums his way across five engaging tracks of heart-wrenching balladry. This guy writes songs for people who plan on hanging on his every word and note. A couple of songs paled in comparison to others, but the difference is slight. No complaints, really. It's a must for fans, and an OK start for the curious.

What do you think of this EP? Love it? Hate it? Why? Favorite track? How does it compare to the Wild Hunt?
