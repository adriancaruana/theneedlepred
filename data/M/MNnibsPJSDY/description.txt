John Legend / Roots review: http://bit.ly/d9IGqm

Belle & Sebastian's latest record follows suit with nearly everything they've done in the past. It's loaded with light and easygoing pop songs that make the perfect soundtrack for flying a kite or painting with watercolors. 

The unfortunate problem is much of this album sounds far too close to the releases preceding it. It's got some great pieces of songwriting here and there, but nothing to make it stand out as a significant peak in the band's fourteen years of material.

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why? Is it the best thing you've heard all year? Is it the best thing you've heard from B&S? 

6/10
