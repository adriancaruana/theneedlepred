Thundercat's debut full-length is a fantastically modernized tribute to the strain of jazz fusion that was coming out in the late 70s and early 80s. From George Duke to Jaco Pastorious, some of the genre's best and brightest musicians maintain a legacy through albums like this.

Though I was a little disappointed by the overall length of some of these tracks--c'mon, two minutes--the style, musicianship, and production are all great enough to keep me coming back to this release again and again.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
