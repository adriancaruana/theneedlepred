On some level, I consider myself a fan of Wolves In the Throne Room: the Olympia, Washington black metal outfit. If I wasn't, I don't think I would have followed their exploits up until this point. I don't see myself quitting, but I wasn't as into Celestial Lineage as I thought I would be. 

It's not for lack of trying, or for a lack of ambition, though. Wolves In the Throne Room do their damnedest to makes this sound like a new record, throwing in more female vocals, harp, sound effects, and synthesizers. 

The issue for me is that these songs sound a little so similar to what this band has been doing for its past three albums. The way these songs are written is just keeping this release from sounding, well, new to me.

What do you think of this album? Love it? hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
