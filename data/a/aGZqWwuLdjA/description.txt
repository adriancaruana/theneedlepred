On the first track to drop from Feist's upcoming album, Metals, the instrumentation hits a light groove as the lyrics detail a story about finding a love that was once there. However, all efforts seem to be doomed from the start.

The music doesn't come on hard. It functions more on subtleties than obvious pop trickery, which makes this an interesting song to drop before the release of Metals. Will this track be upbeat in comparison to the rest?

The ending could have been more developed, and there could have been more contrast between the verses and choruses. Still, for me, this is a pretty solid tune. I love hearing Feist tell this narrative, and climb to breezy highs and depressing lows with her voice. Not completely filling, but a great appetizer.

What do you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

7/10
