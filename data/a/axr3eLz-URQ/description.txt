While the incredible brevity of this new Tony Molina record makes it a little gimmicky, the infectious melodies and breakup album concept are enough to make me overlook that most of the time. If you like your power pop rough and punk-influenced, give this a listen.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
