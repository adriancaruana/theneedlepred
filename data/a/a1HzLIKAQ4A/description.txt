On their 9th album, the Roots have kept their sound soulful and sobering. This album is the sound of recovery, and the point of view of a human being with a long road of improvements ahead. Great beats, piano, and rhymes make this thing too powerful to deny; plus, the guest spots from Monsters of Folk, Joanna Newsom, and John Legend put some real separation between the tracks. It really is a great album, and a high point for hip hop in 2010.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?
