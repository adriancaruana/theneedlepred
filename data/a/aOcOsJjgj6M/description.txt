This first single from Dum Dum Girls' debut album is a catchy piece of sunbaked garage pop. There's a bit of apathy to the music I'm not a huge fan of, but DDG is a group you must be into if the sounds of Black Tambourine, Vivian Girls, or Best Coast get your musical goat. Though it didn't blow me away, I do have respect for this sound. Give it some ear time and let me know what you think?

Love the song? Hate the song? Why?
