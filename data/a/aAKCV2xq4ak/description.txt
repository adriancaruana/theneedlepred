Connecticut rapper Apathy brings a modern feel to the classic sounds of East Coast hip hop on his latest album, Honkey Kong. Though this LP doesn't experiment or step over any major boundaries, it does come with a lot of consistency, quotable lyricism, and solid beats.

Despite a few forgettable beats and corny hooks,  the brighter spots on this LP are great enough to outshine the darker ones. 

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
