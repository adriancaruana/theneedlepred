With its first album in 10 years, Canadian post-rock giants Godspeed You! Black Emperor manage to bring the same intensity, grit, melodic sensibilities, and ambition that has made the band's previous material so great.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
