Röyksopp's fourth album comes quickly on the heels of their third, and serves as a stark contrast to it's predecessor. Rather than solidifying their sound further with the electropop beats and guest vocalists on Junior, Röyksopp has released an album of weary instrumentals powered by retro synths and drum machines.

It's a great sound, but not all that distinct--especially considering how much electronica of this variety I've been able to enjoy this year. Though it's not an offensively bad record, I was having a difficult time finding anything unique or overtly interesting about it. There are a few times this album reaches an outstanding pique, but it doesn't keep the magic together long enough to warrant any heavy praise. However, that's just my opinion.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
