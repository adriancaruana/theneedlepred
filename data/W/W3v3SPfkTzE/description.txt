Singer-songriter Jenny Hval's sophomore full-length has its share of jumbled ideas with obvious inspirations, but sometimes her vocal expressions and songwriting are just enough to keep this album intriguing and somewhat moving.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
