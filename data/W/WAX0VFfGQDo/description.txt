On Paramatma, Mono/Poly digs into the same sandbox artists like Flying Lotus, Ras G, and Daedalus have. He flirts with hip hop, electro, dubstep, but fails to hammer out a sound that separates him from his contemporaries. Overall, the album is a little disjointed, but there are still a lot of standout tracks that have me looking forward to what this guy may put out in the future. If you can appreciate any of the artists I mentioned at the top of this paragraph, play Mono/Poly and see what happens.
