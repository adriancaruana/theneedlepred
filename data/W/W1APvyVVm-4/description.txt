Toronto's Thantifaxath have come through with one of the most ferocious, explosive, and well-recorded black metal records you're sure to hear this year. There's a slight prog rock tinge to the songwriting, too.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
