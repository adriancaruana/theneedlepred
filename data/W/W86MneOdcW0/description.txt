Teen Daze debut EP is a relaxing, beat-driven set of tracks that'll chill your bones and heat up the dancefloor. It's an easygoing release that's perfect for summer. My one and only issue with it is the sounds are really nothing to get excited about. It would have been great to hear some more adventure in that department, but the beats have me content enough for now.
