Latest album from Here We Go Magic is yummy and full of Krautrock influences for the win. I dig it, but there are a few tracks that meander, while two in particular feel a bit too much like filler. Other than that, I'm loving the sound and direction of this LP, and am excited for where this project is going next.

7/10
