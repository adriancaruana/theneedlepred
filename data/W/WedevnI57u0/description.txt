Loaded with insipid lyrics, amateur singing, and childish melodies, it's pretty clear the the pop duo known as Cults has no desire whatsoever to mature their sound. There's definitely more ambition on this record on the instrumental side; featuring an increase in instrumental layers. However, what ends up making Static a sophomore slump for this indie buzz alum is its serious lack of single power.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
