This compilation is a 20-track snapshot of the Kuckuck label's humble beginnings. The record company came at a time when experimental rock--dubbed "krautrock" at the time--was getting into full swing, and experimenting with jazz, folk, and synths. There are a lot of left curves on this release; including film music, some spots of minimalism, and a little noise, too. Overall, a ton of variety, and a fun, exciting look at a lost rock relic.
