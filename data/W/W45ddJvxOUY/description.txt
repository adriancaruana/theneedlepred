Southern California's Xibalba drags listeners down to the "place of fear" the band's name references, combining the heaviness of doom and sludge with the aggression of hardcore punk and even metalcore. Sunn O)))'s Greg Anderson shows up on a few tracks, too.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
