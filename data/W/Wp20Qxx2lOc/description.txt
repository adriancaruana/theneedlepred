Ulcerate's latest album might not hit the spot for fans of the New Zealand group's more hectic material, but it definitely resonated with me. The relentless drumming and dissonant guitar passages create an ugly atmosphere that's ever-evolving. These guys display an extreme level of technical precision on each of these seven tracks, but the music isn't so flashy that it loses me. In fact, that precision manifests itself into a ton of interplay and some sick grooves that are almost too dizzying to follow.

It's a solid metal album. I may not be completely down with how it was mixed, but the performances are absolutely stellar. Definitely a heavy treat.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?

7/10
