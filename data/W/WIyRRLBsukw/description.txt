On their sophomore album, Australia's the UV Race brings garage rock to a dirtier and grimier level than most. The band's loose song structures and loose playing bring a lot of, well, "character" to these recordings. There are flubbed notes everywhere, and it's all for the sake of sounding noisier.

Chaos within limits is the name of the game on Homo, and I'll be dammed if these guys didn't make sounding messy feel fun as hell!

There's an obvious Velvet Underground influence flowing throughout this. A lot of these tracks feel like abridged versions of the song "Sister Ray," but there's also a lot of love if you're more of a fan of the Fall or the Stooges.

It's a raw, loud mess, but I'm too busy dancing to clean it up.

What do you think of this album? Do you love it? Do you hate it? Whyyyy? What should I review next, eh?
