On Blood Ceremony's second album, the Canadian band embraces a traditional style of doom metal; but they still manage to make worlds collide. With guitar riffs coming straight out of the Toni Iommi playbook and flute playing that calls out to Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson, this album is like a rock nerd fantasy collaboration come true! 

Everything from the musicianship to the recording style on this album is pretty damn solid. I'm not 100% on the vocals, but it's a detail I can overlook when everything else I'm dealing with here is so rich, smoky, and flavorful. 

What did you think of this album? What should I review next? I like you!
