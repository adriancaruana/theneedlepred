Death Grips' first mixtape is a grim look at mankind's worst personality traits:: greed, addiction, anger. And the beats are just as offensive as the screamed rap vocals--which only helps get the point across.

It's an energetic record. It's an intense record. Sometimes it's over the top, but I love it.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?
