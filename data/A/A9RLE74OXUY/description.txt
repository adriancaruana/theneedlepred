7/10 http://bit.ly/9k9Chc

Gorillaz latest LP is as dynamic as their previous efforts, but much more conceptual and cohesive. This thing leafs through hip hop, new wave, soul, and trip hop without batting an eye; plus, there's a ton of fantastic guest collaborators: Snoop Dogg, Mick Jones, Lou Reed, and De La Soul to name a few! There were a few bumps along the way, but this thing is a journey from beginning to end. There are some real 10/10s along the way, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to any pop fan. 

How do YOU feel about this LP? Did you dig it? Hate it? Why?
