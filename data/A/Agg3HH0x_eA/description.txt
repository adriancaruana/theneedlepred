Siriusmo's debut LP is a bipolar exploration through the German electronica producer's psyche. Not to say that he's crazy, but his music is a little all over the place.

This is because Siriusmo has absolutely no interest in appealing to one particular type of electronic music fan. This album is littered with club bangers, dubstep bass, odd samples, and subtle flourishes of syths. 

Though Siriusmo proves he's comfortable just about everywhere, not every song feels as finished as the next. Some cut and run before they really get to leave an impression, sadly. However, if you love variety, this will keep you coming back, I'm sure.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

7/10
