On their debut full length, Brooklyn's Suckers move further to define their sound with a plethora of builds, falls, and great instrumentation. My one problem is the group hardly trumps what they did on their first EP, and even goes as far as to reprint one of the songs from it onto this album. Still a great release with standout songs, but wished some of the hooks wowed me a bit more.

What do you think of this album? Love it? hate it? Why?
