Two more perspectives on this album:

Agalloch's fourth studio album is an interesting followup to 2006's Ashes Against the Grain. Marrow of the Spirit is nowhere near as distorted or heavy, but the band manages to overcome that with a lot more melody, dynamics, and acoustic instrumentation.

There are still some really brooding moments, and the long song lengths only enhance the dark mood the music shoots for. John Haughm really works to change up his vocal style on some pivotal points of the album, and the entire experience is really cohesive and cinematic.

This is another triumph for the band's discography, but it  really shouldn't be a surprise considering how consistent they've been thus far.

What did you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
