On his new set of EPs, Wisconsin rapper Rory Ferreira, a.k.a. Milo, changes his instrumental game, rapping over some pretty spacious, atmospheric beats. On top of that, he's strengthened his usual barrage of obtuse personal musings; bringing their emotional potency higher than ever.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
