This latest track from Magic Kids has got me amped for their upcoming album. If the songs on there are greater than this, I'll be swooning with joy. There's a ton of influence from the Beach Boys on this one, and it's got the grandiose strings and horns to prove it. This thing is a big time indie production that demands attention from the get go. 

Sweet, innocent, and undeniable. If only it didn't sound so much like 4 to 5 other things.

7/10
