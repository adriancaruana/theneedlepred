Skrillex 2nd EP release this year features some pretty impressive mixes of progressive house, electro, and dubstep. It's a winning combination of raw experimentation and the desire to just make a fantastic dance track.

Unfortunately, not every song follows this formula. Skrillex reels in a lot of his eccentric edits on the second half of this EP, and the remixes tacked on the end are certainly decent.

He's just starting to build a name for himself with this stuff. While the entire release isn't mind-blowing, there are some highly enjoyable tracks that bring a lot of surprises and creativity to the table.

What do you think of this thing? Love it? Hate it? Why?
