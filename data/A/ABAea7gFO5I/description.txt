On Anderson's latest album, she pretty much sticks to her guns, but takes on some notable collaborations with Four Tet, Antony Hegarty, John Zorn, and Lou Reed. Though this new LP is business as usual, her ability to pull apart society's problems is still sharp. Cold electronics and abstract lyrics make this thing dance the same surreal steps Big Science did, but the slightly updated tricks still work, believe it or not.
