On Miguel's sophomore album, the contemporary R&B singer reinvents his image and sound to create a futuristic fusion with elements of rock, synth pop, and funk. Hopefully, the production on his next record reaches the fine-tuned ambition of his singing and songwriting.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
