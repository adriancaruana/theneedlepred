Tame Impala brings back the sounds of 60s psych like it's nobody's business, but I can't help but feel like the band is more of an exercise in nostalgia than anything else. 

The accuracy Tame executes these sounds with is almost unprecedented, but I'm still having trouble seeing this LP as standout or highly-enjoyable. Personally, I've enjoyed a lot of music like this throughout my life, and fail to see how this album brings anything different to the table. There are some newer and interesting sounds on it, though.

If you're looking to get into psych, though, I'd highly recommend this. 

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?
