M.I.A.'s new mixtape magnifies a lot of those experimental dance elements that I liked from her last album. The beats are relentless, and I love the way this thing evolves into track after track over the course of these 36 minutes.

My only issue is that I wish the mixtape was more impressive from a vocal perspective; however, if you're looking for something upbeat, danceable, and maybe workout-worthy, then hit this thing up.

What did you think of this mixtape? Love it? hate it? Why?
