I won't say Push The Sky Away is Nick Cave's darkest album yet, but it's easily one of his most depressing--so much so that Cave himself seems too shaken to engage his listeners with the same emotional potency he usually does.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
