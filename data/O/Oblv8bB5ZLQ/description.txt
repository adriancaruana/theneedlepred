Zach Hill's latest solo effort is just as abrasive and cacophonous as his last--but maybe there's even less restraint to be found here. While the album accomplishes what it sets out to do, that doesn't mean I'm enjoying it all that much.

If you're in the market for something that will make your eyes cross and ears run red with blood, head in this direction. But the album, for me, kind of straddles a weird spot between the accessible and experimental which just isn't agreeing with me. Sure, give me the accessible, or even put on a little noise music; but the combination of these two ideas on Face Tat just leaves me with an empty feeling. It's as if I've gained nothing from it.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?

5/10
