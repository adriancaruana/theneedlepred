"Tighten Up" song / SAAM Review: http://bit.ly/b15O7P / http://bit.ly/cgfJsg

This latest track from the Black Keys' upcoming Brothers is a decent track, but I can't help but hear the band walk down their own beaten path on this one. "Tighten Up" had some much more definitive qualities to it, but it's hard to ignore BK falling into the same exactly sun-baked retro-rock formula that brought them where they are today. Nothing inherently wrong with this track, but maybe just a little too familiar. Probably a decent intro for first-time listeners, and I'm still expecting this LP to rule. Hope it's as good as Attack and Release.

What did you think of the track? Love it? Hate it? Why?
