For his last album Xasthur has pulled together some production and sounds that dwarf what we heard on his previous album, All Reflections Drained. But sonically is the only way the work here advances. In terms of structure and melody, this album is still very much made of interludes that range from sort of engaging to not so engaging. Some of the musicianship is appallingly sloppy, too, which can make it difficult to take the dark moods of this album seriously. I like the sounds, but not much else.

What do you think of this album? Do you love it? Hate it? Is this a good or bad end for Xasthur? Are you looking forward to Conner's forthcoming projects?

4/10
