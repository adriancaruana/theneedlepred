If you love cute rock tunes with a dismal outlook on life, Veronica Falls might be the band for you. Their latest LP is simple, immediate, and catchy. I know it's easy to get down on something that sounds so easy to execute, but the energy and moody aesthetic that surround this band are something worth admiring to me.

They might not reinvent the styles of rock that influence them--twee and C86, I'm assuming--but they perform it with the fresh approach that the forefathers of this stuff did in the 80s.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
