Canadian MC Shad's latest album is one of his most ambitious yet. The guy spits his usual brand of clever, playful wordplay over some pretty bright, uplifting instrumentals, I wish the sadder tracks had more emotional impact, though.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
