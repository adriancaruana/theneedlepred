Come Sunday is the second installment of traditional songs and spirituals from jazz veterans Charlie Haden and Hank Jones. I don't prefer it to the first album the duo released, Steal Away, but it's an enjoyable listen for fans of this genre.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
