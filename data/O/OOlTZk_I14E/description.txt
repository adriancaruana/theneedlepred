Caribou's latest album is undoubtedly one of Dan Snaith's most accessible releases, but he still manages to keep his usual experimentalisms in the fold. 

There are some fantastic grooves on this album, but there were some moments that sort of felt like "work in progress" or just put in place for the sake of getting the sound or idea down on paper--not necessarilly becuase it made a great track or song. 

If you've enjoyed Snaith's past releases, this is worth your time. I'd also recommend it to Four Tet fans, Pantha Du Prince fans, and Arthur Russell fans. If you value adventure and stretching out, this is probably where you want to be. But for those who might want their music accessible, Swim is heavily lined with dance beats, so there's no reason to fear for your attention span.

Decent album. Just some mixing moments I wasn't down with completely, and just felt some tracks paled in comparison to others--for example, Odessa, Leave House, Bowls, Hannibal.

6/10
