On Best Coast's debut album, the project really brings what the singles promised: sunny songs for the summer heat. Lots of distorted guitars, reverb-soaked drums, and lethargic lyrics. It's a nice formula, but it's not exactly the kind of place I want to be for thirteen songs straight. Unfortunately, there's not much variation among these songs, and it's hard for me to fall in love with this album because of it. There are a few standout tracks, but no reason to stop  the presses. 

If you're looking for an album that'll soundtrack your summer, though, this should be your next stop. What do you think of this album? Do you love it? Why? Hate it? Why, oh, why!?
