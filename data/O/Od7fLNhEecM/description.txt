Alternative rock outfit Cage the Elephant completely surprises me with a record of songs that have uniformly interesting production, energetic performances, memorable hooks, sharp melodies, and a pretty diverse array of instrumentation. Bravo!

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
