Detroit rapper Quelle Chris isn't the most energetic MC, but his laid-back delivery approach is complemented with an eccentric cadence, thought-provoking bars, and some ridiculous song topics. If only his bold ideas were a little more well-organized, refined.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
