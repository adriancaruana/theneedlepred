On Boris' latest albums, the band seeks to simplify their sound a bit. While they have made their style a little more accessible--especially on Attention Please--I don't think it's translated into something that's exactly catchy or memorable.

Still, there are some pretty heavy moments on Heavy Rocks that may be worth revisiting for me, but it's not like the band hasn't gone hard on the previous Heavy Rocks or their other albums, too.

What do you think of this albums? Love 'em? Hate 'em? Why? What should I review next, eh?

6/10 & 4/10
