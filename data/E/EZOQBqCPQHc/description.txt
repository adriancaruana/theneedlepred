Tonetta's first full-length compilation is a great display of what this Canadian singer-songwriter has to offer: Mutant bedroom jams about sex, drugs, and more sex. Tonetta does touch down on politics, family, and other things on this album, but shock value is part of what makes this music so attractive.

The songs are pretty hit or miss for me, though, and it's hard not to feel as if something is missing when you're listening to the songs without the videos backing them up. Plus, chances are some of your favorite Tonetta songs aren't on this thing. If there's any reason to pick this up, it's so support one of YouTube's oddest entertainers.

What do you think of this compilation? Love it? Hate it? Why?

6/10
