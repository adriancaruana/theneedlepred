On this latest album, California's The Morning Benders step up their studio production and shoot for a a new direction with their music. With Grizzly Bear's Chris Taylor getting co-production credits, it should be no surprise Big Echo is sounding a lot like his band's previous efforts.

For me, this new approach is having some really mixed results. Some of the added instrumentation and interludes distract from the songs more than they add. The constant interludes take each track through detour after detour without showing anything all that scenic, to be honest. 

There are some real bangers on Big Echo, though. They just happen to be the most straightforward songs. There's no reason to lose faith in this band, but this album is clearly the sound of them executing their new-found ideas for the first time.
