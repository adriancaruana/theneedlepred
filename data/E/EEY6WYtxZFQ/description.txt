On the band's first effort in over 20 years, My Bloody Valentine doesn't overreach their seminal efforts on Loveless, but the band still proves they have a hefty amount of relevance and creativity to spare when it comes to shoegaze.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
