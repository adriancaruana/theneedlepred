On Desert Fires Sarah Lipstate takes it easy on the ears she tore to shreds on her previous album; heading in a more serene direction with her guitar-driven noise and drone. Many of these tracks follow clear chord progressions, and feature rushing waves of sonic swells in the background. It never gets mind-blowingly loud, but that's not really the point this time around. Instead, this LP is a much more calming experience. A little more bleak, a little less unsettling.

What do you think of this album? What do you think of ambient music? Drone music? Noise? Cal Chuchesta?
