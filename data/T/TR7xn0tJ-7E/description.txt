While Hudson Mohawke's new EP isn't flashy, detailed, or technically impressive, I still have a lot of fun listening to it. For lack of a better word, I think what actually attracts me to the instrumentals on this thing is that they sound, well, dorky!

What do you think of this EP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
