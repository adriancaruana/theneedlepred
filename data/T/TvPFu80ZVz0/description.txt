On Panda Bear's new single, there's no reason for alarm. The guy hasn't done much to shift his sound away from Person Pitch. Maybe he's gotten a bit more straightforward, but psychedelic effects and repetition still drive the but to its final destination.

Tomboy was a little too simple for my tastes, but Slow Motion borders on amazing. What did you think of these two tracks? Love 'em? Hate 'em? Why?
