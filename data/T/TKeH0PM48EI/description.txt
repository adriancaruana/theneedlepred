New York rapper Joey Bada$$ follows up his infamous 1999 mixtape with a collection of tracks that feel more like a sequel from Pro Era's recently released PEEP: The aPROcalypse mixtape. Still a solid effort, though.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
