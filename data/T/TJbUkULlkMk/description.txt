On its second full-length album, Local Natives still sits in the shadow of bands like Fleet Foxes and Grizzly Bear, which is something even the band's most hardcore fans are willing to admit. I guess the issue is that I personally feel the group doesn't take its very obvious influences and twist them into something that feels distinct to the band. There's not much in the way of personality, melody, or sound that's hooking me here. I can understand if music fans want to hear more of a certain kind of sound--I guess this is just now the sound I"m looking to hear more of.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
