I wish Silent Hour / Golden Mile was longer, but I still have to admit singer-songwriter Daniel Rossen has pulled together a solid collection of solo material on this 5-track EP. The man's tunes are some of the most masterful in independent music right now.

What do you think of this EP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, too?
