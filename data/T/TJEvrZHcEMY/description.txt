On Ghostface Killah's latest project, he's working with composer and multi-instrumentalist Adrian Younge. Together, they create a fantastically conceptual album that's loaded with all the b-movie thrills a Wu-Tang fan could ask for.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
