Rush fans are pretty psyched about this new album, and I could see why. Clockwork Angels is definitely the best record the band has put out since 2000, but I'm not sure if, personally, it entertains as much as the group's classics.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
