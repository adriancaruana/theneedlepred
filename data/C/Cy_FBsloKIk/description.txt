Diamond Rings' debut full-length is a pop album that knows its limits, but shows no signs of shame or fear. The project's founder, John O, brings passion into everything  he touches on this album. The vocal delivery is ballsy, the synths are bubbly and playful, the drum machines invite thoughts of a bedroom dance party. There's a load of ambition here, but the only sad part is Special Affections lacks the power and the flash to bring it to the next level. However, I think that's something to be anticipated for the next album. For now, this'll do just fine.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? Favorite track? Are music videos important? Do they make musicians more relevant?
