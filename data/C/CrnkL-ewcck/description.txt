On its latest release, Woods make their sound a little sunnier with brighter guitar leads and attitudes. But some of the songs here just feel too unfinished to really feel memorable or exciting for me. I dig this band a lot, but I almost feel like I've fallen off the wagon on this one.

Their past several records, in my opinion, have been fantastic. This feels like it lives in the shadow of Woods' previous material because of its underwhelming execution, half-baked songs, and melodies that are eerily similar to that of past material from this band.

Plus, what's possibly the most enjoyable track here is a cover song.

I'm not on board with this album, sadly, but these guys seem to drop something new about every year. Maybe I'll like the next release more. 

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I revnew next, eh?

5/10
