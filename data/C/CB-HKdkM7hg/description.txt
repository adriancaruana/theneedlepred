Twin Shadow's Forget is the stuff great debuts are made of: songs that get to the point; hooks that stay with you all day long; and the kind of production that begins to forge a distinct sound.

From disco to new wave to post-punk, this album seems to dabble in nearly every fusion of dance and rock music. It's a style of music I'm a bit of a sucker for, but I think the songwriting is too good to deny.

The album's major flaw is a slightly muddy recording quality. There are also some slight musical flubs here and there. Nothing that didn't stop me from enjoying it, though.

What do you think of this record? Love it? Hate it? Favorite track?
