On his third album, Shad displays a lot of great wordplay and personality, but I have a lot of reservations with the production and the hooks. I understand he may want to set a serious tone for some of these tracks, but the sad and bland instrumentation isn't having a very positive effect on me. In fact, it's making me want to sympathize with the songs a bit less.

What do you think of this album? Shad? Love it / him? Why? What should I review next?

6/10
