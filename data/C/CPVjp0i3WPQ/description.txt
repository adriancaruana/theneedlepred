On My Brightest Diamond's newest album, singer-songwriter Shara Worden releases another set of heavily orchestrated art pop tunes. This time, many of the lyrical themes revolve heavily around relationships.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

6/10
