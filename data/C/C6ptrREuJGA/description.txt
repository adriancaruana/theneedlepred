Once again, the Portland outfit STRFKR drops a collection of tracks that sound like they're the demos for what could be a pretty good synth pop album. However, that's not the case; these flat, nondescript indie dance tunes are the album.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
