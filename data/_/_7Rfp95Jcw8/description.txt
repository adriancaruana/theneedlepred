La Dispute comes through with a worthwhile followup to 2011's WIldlife. While some of the stories aren't as enthralling, the band's minor alterations to their sound this time around makes this record worth checking out if you've been following them up until this point, or if you're a general fan of post-hardcore with poetic lyrics.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
