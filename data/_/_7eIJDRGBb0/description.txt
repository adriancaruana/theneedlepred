Dirty Projectors are sounding like a slighty more toned down version of their usual selves on this new album. While it's certainly not a bad LP, it's not really entertaining me on the same level their previous material has.

What did you think of this album? Did you friggin' love it? Hate it? Man, you hated it? Why, why, why? What should I review next, too. Lemme know, please. Stay awesome. Be good. A thousand hugs to you. xoxo
