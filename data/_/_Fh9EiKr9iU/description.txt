Shlohmo's Bad Vibes is a nice set of thirteen beats that will chill out just about any situation. The music here functions on different levels of listening. They're great as ambient backdrops, but can be explored actively as well.

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
