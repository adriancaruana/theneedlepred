On their fourth album, New York black metal outfit delivers roughly the same sound they've been working with for the previous three. However, despite the lack of shockingly new ideas, the band proves to hold a lot of compositional power in the methodically fine-tuned progressive black metal style they've made their calling card.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
