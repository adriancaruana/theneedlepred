Tyler,The Creator's full-length debut is a surprising collection of beats and rhymes coming from a teenage kid. On this album, Tyler lashes out against hip hop, his negligent father, and rap blogs. He says most things for the lulz, but it's hard not to laugh along with him.

There's a lot of darkness on this album, too, where Tyler creates a killing, raping, and kidnapping persona who shows little to no sympathy for anything. It's hard not to compare it to DOOM or Eminem's early work.

There are some pretty decent beats flowing throughout this thing, too. It's a little too indulgent, but that's the nature of this album. It feels like Tyler was making this music for himself, mostly, which is what makes it such an interesting listen.
