Weedeater's new LP is a heavy piece of work. This album's got a lot of rumble to it, but I'd say the sound here grinds your ear drums more than it shake's 'em. The filthy distortion and Dave Collins' trademark vocals make a great combo on this thing, creating some of the best sludge metal I've heard in a while.

The problem is the LP is weighed down by a bit of filler tho. There are moments I'm just not interested in here, sadly. However, the heavier tracks this album has to offer are still making this thing worth a listen. 

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next? Should I review what I want?
