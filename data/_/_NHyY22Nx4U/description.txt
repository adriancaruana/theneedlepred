This track is a brave step in a more experimental direction for MGMT. The neo psych band hasn't shed their pop roots, but they're getting more ambitious and more engaging. The days of "Kids" and "Electric Feel" might be over. That may be bad news for some, but I think it's great that the band is going down a less-traveled road, here. The production is a little hectic, but still lush and colorful. Some simpler instrumentation would have made the hook stand out a big more, I think. Other than that, I dug it quite a bit. 

What did you think of it? Does this song remind you of any songs in particular? Is this a good direction for MGMT? Do you miss style of their old singles? Do you think the band is going to get more "epic" on this album?
