On the first track to drop from Bjork's forthcoming album, Biophilia, the Icelandic singer-songwriter just doesn't do a lot for me, honestly. I was pretty excited about this track, too.

It's certainly got all the makings of a great Bjork track--some strong vocals and personality, ear-grabbing instrumentation, a climax--but I'm left hanging by how little this song really changes or progresses as it moves from the its beginning to its end.

But this track is off of what's supposed to eventually be an all-out multimedia project, including videos to accompany each track. Maybe I'm really only getting half the story by listen to this song by itself.

What do you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
