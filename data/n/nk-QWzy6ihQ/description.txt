Toronto rapper Drake is back with his 3rd commercial release, Nothing Was The Same. Here, Drake continues with his lyrical obsession with the tattered relationships of his past, which is fine, but he hops on a gauntlet of nutty trap beats on this LP that are less than flattering to his clean-cut persona.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
