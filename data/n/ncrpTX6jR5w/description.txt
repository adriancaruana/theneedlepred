Review of Songs of Shame: http://bit.ly/cOgDF7

Brooklyn's Woods specialize in creepy, haunting folk rock, fronted with some distinct falsetto vocals. It's like a dead creepy guy singing in my ear. Y'all may remember I loved their last album, Songs of Shame, and At Echo Lake is a worth follow-up, for sure. There's more variation and a slightly more upbeat attitude. I just wish this band would bite the bullet and come out with something a little more fleshed out, but the style here is still unique enough to keep me interested, really interested.
