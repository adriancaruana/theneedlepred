Autechre's 10th album, much like their nine previous efforts, brings challenges, experiments, and bewilderment. The duo is as abstract as they've ever been, heading in a softer, more ambient approach for this release. The gentler direction resembles that of their 1994 album Amber, but with a wider sonic vocabulary. Oversteps doesn't offer much in terms of clear song structures, too. It's an album that would much rather explore than plan out a route. 

To be honest, I found their last album to be a lot more thrilling, but what works for me might not work for you. If you're looking for something that quietly cuts its way through the digital jungle. Oversteps should be your destination.
