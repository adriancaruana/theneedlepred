Kids & Explosions' debut album is a spastic and relentless collage of pop's catchiest moments. Instead of allowing one sample to simply play over another, K&E dives in deep to each sample and tears it into little, tiny pieces; making everything work together rhythmically and melodically.

I realize some moments aren't all that subtle, and that this record gets pretty relentless with its edits; however, this interests me because it's the true meaning of collage music. 

Everything is destroyed and rebuilt using the scrap. Pretty inspiring. 

What do you think of this record? Love it? Hate it? Why?
