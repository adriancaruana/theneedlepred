On her latest effort, Angel Olsen delivers a quaint and simple set of contemporary folk tunes with a few alt-country detours. Though the sounds are pretty familiar, it's her wonderfully bold voice that brings it all together.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
