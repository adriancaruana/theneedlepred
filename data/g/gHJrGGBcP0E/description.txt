Daughters' self-titled album is one of the best punishments I've had all year. In terms of being noisy and aggressive as hell, it's almost up there with that Little Women album I reviewed, but I could see this LP coming across as being a lot more accessible than that one. It's more accessible than Daughters' earlier work, too. Very cohesive, very aggressive, and very pleasurable if you're looking for something to knock you out of your chair.
