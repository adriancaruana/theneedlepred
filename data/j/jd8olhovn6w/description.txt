This latest track from Blur is the band's first official release in seven years. The band has been held up with other things--maybe one of 'em is Gorillaz--but they can still whip out a great tune. This ditty plays heavy on the ideas of monotony, boredom, and everyday life--or at least I think it does. The melody is great, the production is amazing, and it's fantastically easy on the ears. I'm really feeling this one.

What do you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Why?

8/10
