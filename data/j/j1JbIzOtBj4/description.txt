Wild Beast's Smother shows the band toning things down, and making a sound that comes off eerier than the material on their previous two albums. Though this LP still holds some of the grooves their last albums did, the songs here carry a much more serious tone--maybe too serious?

There are some great tunes and passionate vocals here, but a good chunk of these tracks come off as being merely agreeable--you know, not offending or enthralling.

I'll be listening for this band's next release, because I am intrigued by what their next move will be, but I'm still stopping just short of loving this LP.

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why?

7/10
