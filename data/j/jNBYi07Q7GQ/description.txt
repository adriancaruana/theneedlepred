Blonde Redhead's Penny Sparkle is a big move toward softer and more sensual sounds. These ideas have always played a role in the band's albums in one track or another, but Redhead consistently explores this idea for 10 blissful tracks of sweet vocals and entrancing synths. It's almost a sexual powerhouse. 

I'm digging it a lot, but what do y'all think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why, why, why? How would you score it? What do you think of dream pop? Is it a term / genre? Does it apply here? Do you miss BR's old sound? Do you like this new one better?
