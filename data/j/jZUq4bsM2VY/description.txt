Aside from a few unnecessary tracks that could have been a lot better with some more fleshing out, the new Flatbush Zombies tape is incredibly solid, grimy, cunning, and hilarious. Instrumentally, vocally, and lyrically, these three Flatbush natives bring plenty of thrills and personality.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
