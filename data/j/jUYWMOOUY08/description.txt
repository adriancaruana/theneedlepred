On veteran electronic music producer Squarepusher's latest effort, there's a big return to the more electronic side of the project's artistry. However, it doesn't feel as fresh as it used to--even with the newly incorporated elements of dubstep in some of these tracks.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
