James Blake's take on "Limit to Your Love" is a quiet one. He does the Feist song a lot of quiet justice on this cover; filling it with nothing but hard-hitting piano chords and whispering electronics.

It's a stunning buildup to what could be a fantastic album.

What do you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Why? Is the original version better?

8/10
