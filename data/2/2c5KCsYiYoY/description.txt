Wild Flag's self-titled debut album is a light, fun, and upbeat reformation for these indie rock veterans. I think some longtime fans--especially those in the Sleater-Kinney camp--will expect a little bit more. That's fine and understandable. I feel the same way to an extent. 

However, after several listens, the simplicity of this album no longer bugged me. Instead, it made this album catchy and invigorating. These ladies know what complicated music is, and this project is obviously a conscious effort to make something more straightforward, you know?

This album is a handful of tracks that aim straight for those looking to shake hips, sway shoulders, and raise fists.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

7/10
