Destroyer's latest album is an unexpected change of pace from Dan Bejar and the gang. Rather than continuing to embrace the folk, glam, baroque pop aesthetics that brought the band this far, Kaputt emulates the sounds of disco, new wave, and smooth jazz.

At first, it was almost a shock for me to hear this, but don't take this album for a simple novelty or indulgence. Destroyer's songwriting and personality are stronger than ever on this record. Plus, the production is some of the best this band has had the opportunity to show off.

Whether it's a straightforward pop ballads, or a vast, ambient introduction on tracks like "Bay of Pigs," this album's attention to detail, style, and poetic sensuality should seduce most who come into contact with it. I'm getting hot just thinking about it.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
