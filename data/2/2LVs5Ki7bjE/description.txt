This track from the new DsO album is aggressive as hell, but it never seems to settle into anything that's all that memorable. Instead, the band chooses to constantly throw difficult changes and dissonant riffs into the mix as a relentless pace. 

Though that's not necessarily a bad thing--and there are plenty of other bands that do this, so it's not like this kind of practice is unheard of--it doesn't really captivate me in this particular instance. There are songs on this album that are much more straightforward and memorable, but, sadly, many of Paracletus' tracks go down a path similar to this one.

What did you think of this track? The new album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next? 

5/10
