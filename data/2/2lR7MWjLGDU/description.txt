Art Pop is easily Lady Gaga's most eccentric and colorfully produced album yet. However, she still doesn't go far enough to keep her very radio-friendly band of pop interesting for an entire album--especially when it comes to lyrics.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
