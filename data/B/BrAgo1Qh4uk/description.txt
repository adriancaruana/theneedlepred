While the more slow, syrupy side of Beck's discography appeals to many, it never has to me. Morning Phase shows beck returning to the stomping grounds of albums like Mutations and Sea Change, but with instrumentation and tunes that are far more uninteresting.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
