Avey Tare's Down There is certainly creative and packed with a lucid set of effects, but it's way too close to Animal Collective for comfort. The album willingly stands in the shadow of AnCo's more recent albums when Avey could have easily gone in a different direction. 

It's no doubt the the singing in rounds, the strange loops, and personal lyrics have their appeal. I'm just having trouble seeing that happen outside Animal Collective's current fanbase. 

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? How would you score it? Also, what album should I review next?

5/10
