Though not as much of a bombardment as his previous album, Room(s), Vapor City is a pretty enjoyable and diverse album from electronic music producer Machinedrum. Plus, it features some of his best singles yet!

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
