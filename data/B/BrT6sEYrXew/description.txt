On its latest album, Zombi throws guitars and bass to the wayside, and brings the focus back to the duo's foundation: drums and synths. It might just be the direction longtime fans wanted after the extremely rock-oriented Spirit Animal.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
