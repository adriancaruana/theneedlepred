On their 20th album--20th if you count their collab albums w/Jello Biafra and Lustmord--Melvins sound as evil as ever. Their taste for abusive distortion and percussion has not waned, but the band has grown a lot more absurd on this release. Weird, transitional moments feature squelching horns, weird vocals, and funny keyboards. The strangeness bleeds into some of the tracks, too: "PG x 3," "The Water Glass," and the band's cover of "My Generation." 

Some of the moves Melvins make on this album make me question their sanity, but I know for sure the band hasn't lost it. Songs like "I'll Finish You Off" show they can be the powerhouse we've come to know and love. 

The Melvins are gonna do what they're gonna do. Gotta respect that, but that doesn't mean I'm going to love every minute of it. I'm kind of indifferent on this LP as a whole, but what do you think of it? Love it? hate it? Why? Also, what's your fav Melvins LP?
