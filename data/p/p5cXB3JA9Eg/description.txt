Though it's nice to hear from the boys in Justice again, I can't help but feel like they're just treading water on this first single. There's supposed to be an album following this track later this year, so I'm assuming this song might just be some complacent song the label wanted to release before the album so people wouldn't be worried about a change in sound.

Well, though I'm not worried Justice has done a 180, I am worried I'm gonna be in for the same ol' same ol'. I dug Cross a lot, and even own a copy of it myself. But I do wonder if I'd be interested in having Justice make the same album over again.

I respect the guys as artists, and have seen them live once before, too. I'm definitely gonna listen to whatever they drop, but I'm not all that enthused on this track as a standalone piece. Maybe it'll be better squeezed in between a group of over dancefloor demons.

What do you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Why?
