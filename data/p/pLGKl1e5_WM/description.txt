Chicago rapper and singer Chance The Rapper comes through with a more ambitious mixtape with Acid Rap, improving upon his production, hooks, and recording quality. A lot of the beats on this project are impressive as hell, but Chance often puts hooks, ad-libs, and instrumentals ahead of the quality and cohesion of his lyrical content. Anyone listening deeper than Chance's over-the-top persona will find there's a little something missing.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
