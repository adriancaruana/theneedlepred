With an almost unmeasurable poetic bitterness, Andrew Jackson Jihad are as sharp as ever on their new album, Knife Man. As usual, the music here is about the lyrics. The chord progressions are familiar copies of folk songs and punk tunes. Hell, some of the songs even sound similar to tracks from the band's previous album.

Still, the lyrics here throw me into fits of laughter and depression. These tracks make me swing back and forth like an emotional pendulum. That's the show of a great Andrew Jackson Jihad album. Well, to me, anyway.

What do you think of this album? Love it? hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
