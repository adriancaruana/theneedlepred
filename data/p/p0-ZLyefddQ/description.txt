Iceage's sophomore full-length brings the same downtrodden, depressive ferocity that the band's last album did, but with a bit more length and diversity. While it's not exactly progressive, it's still a blast--just like the debut LP.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
