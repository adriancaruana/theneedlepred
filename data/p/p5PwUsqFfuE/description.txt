On the Knife's latest full-length, the Swedish electronic music duo goes absolutely insane with a 98 minute album that features a ton of long, linear art pop tracks that overload the senses and challenge expectations.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
