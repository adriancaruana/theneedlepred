The Radio Dept.'s third album is an immaculate display of dreamy pop prowess. This group has evenly combined influences from My Bloody Valentine, New Order, Pet Shop Boys, and Cocteau Twins into something that's difficult to trace back to any single band.

The songs and melodies throughout this album are astonishing and relaxing. Highly pleasurable and enjoyable. Just straightforward sweetness, and who can complain about that?

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?
