On this new track, Bon Iver has altered the instrumentation his somber tunes soak in, but not much else. Years after For Emma has dropped, the mood as stayed roughly the same--which is a pretty great thing, to me.

Sincerity, earnestness, honesty, and passion all come through on this one. 

My only issue is that even though Bon Iver's ambition has grown, the recording quality has not. There are a few spots here where the lo-fi sound quality holds things back a bit, but it's not like the song is ruined entirely.

What do you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

7/10
