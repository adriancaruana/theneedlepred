With Christmas Island, Andrew Jackson Jihad comes through with what's essentially their pop album. While the band brings plenty of concise tracks with straightforward instrumentation, they mostly lack the emotional impact of previous material--the instrumental finesse, too.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
