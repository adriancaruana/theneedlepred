On the Bad Plus' latest record, the band continues to focus more on original material than their career-defining covers, and the band manages to create some pretty fantastic, modern jazz tracks in the process--not to mention incorporate synths and drum machines into many of these tunes, too.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
