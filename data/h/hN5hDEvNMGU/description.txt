Unknown Mortal Orchestra's debut full-length surprised me in some places, but underwhelmed in others. I love how effortlessly these guys pull together a fun and bouncy salute to the world of 60s rock and pop. It sounds as fresh as it does retro.

Where this album really ended up losing me, though, was in the song structures, which repeat to the point where a lot of these songs sorta lose their flavor.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
