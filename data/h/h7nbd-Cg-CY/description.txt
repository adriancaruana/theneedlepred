Brian Eno's latest ambient effort sees him returning to his roots in the genre with albums like Ambient 1. At first, I found that pretty refreshing, and I loved the combination of piano, violin, synths, and guitar on these tracks, too. However, the album is seriously lacking in terms of new approaches or variation.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
