Written by Gold Panda and mixed by Simian Mobile Disco's James Shaw, Lucky Shiner is a relaxing, yet groovy, set of beats and samples. Gold Panda drums up some seriously interesting sounds and textures on this new LP, and manages to dip his toe into influences ranging from house music to hip hop on these eleven tracks.

The album isn't the most distinct thing on the planet, but there are some real memorable moments on this debut album.

What did you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
