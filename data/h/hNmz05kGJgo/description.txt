Though it may not be one of the Goat's most ambitious albums, the sounds and stories on All Eternals Deck are earnest and well-written. The lyrics are a potpourri of concepts, ranging from age acceptance to an all-out vampire attack.

In some says, this album is built on the same kind of song and story dynamic that have powered past albums, but there are some new sounds here, too. For example, the harmonized background vocals on "High Hawk Season." String arrangements have always found their way onto more recent albums, too, and that's no different here. But there's definitely some new-found ambition in utilizing them on "Age of Kings" and "Outer Scorpion Squadron."

All in all, it's a strong set of tracks that could entertain both fans and newbies. Darnielle isn't the open book he's been on albums like Sunset Tree and World to Come, but he's back at doing what he does best: Singing the stories of others.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, too? What's your favorite Mountain Goats album?
