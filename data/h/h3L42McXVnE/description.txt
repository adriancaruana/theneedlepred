Mogwai's new live album is impressive. There's no other way to put it, really. Despite some minor flaws, the sound is great and the performances are on point. Considering that so much stuff comes with the purchase of this album--extra tracks, the documentary Burning, and other downloads--you're getting a lotta bang for the buck, here. It's amazing to hear Mogwai bring the dynamics and intensity of their studio work to a live album, and there's definitely a great deal going on here.

What do you guys think of this album? Awesome? Not awesome?
