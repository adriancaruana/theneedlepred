This latest release from Alaska's Portugal. The Man takes a more straightforward approach than anything the band has does in the past. Though it's all done in the name of being immediate and memorable, I can't really say this album is all that catchy or engaging. It's almost too simple to warrant attention. 2008's Censored Colors saw P.TM playing with some masterfully produced glam/folk/progressive rock sounds, and even 2009's The Satanic Satanist beats American Ghetto in the subtlety department. 

The choppy production and hip hop beats on AG just don't lend  all that much originality to the recording. They weight the songs down instead of propping them up, and dumb down the great melodies and songwriting the band has going. Though I would hate to see the band produced another Censored Colors, giving the music a little more time to breathe and build couldn't hurt.

3/10
