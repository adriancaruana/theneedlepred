Brooklyn's the Drum's play hook-heavy drum machine pop. The vocals are loaded with reverb, and there's actually no bass guitar to be found. It's a thin, tinny sound; plus, the vocals are extremely whiny. However, I'm really friggin' diggin' it! The songwriting is just too sweet to deny. These tracks started getting stuck in my head on first listen, no lie.

What do you think of this band and their new album? Love it? Hate it? Why?
