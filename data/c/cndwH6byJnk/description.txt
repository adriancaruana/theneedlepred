Let me start by saying this album is awesome; however, I understand the noisy, disturbing, abusive sounds this Brooklyn quartet makes are not for everyone--not even a little bit. If disorienting musical aggression isn't your thing, I understand. But if it is, then your ears need to be on this band's debut full-length. This group features elements of math rock, free jazz, metal, and punk sped up until they've disintegrated into a fine powder that gets you pretty messed up when snorted. Lots of replay power, great sounds, and raw musicianship. How are we gonna know what's pretty if we don't hear the ugly? This rules.
