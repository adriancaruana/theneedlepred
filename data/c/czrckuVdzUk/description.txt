Luke Abbott's first full-length album, Holkham Drones, is a deep dive into synthesizer worship. It maintains a vintage sound that calls back to the work of Kraftwerk, but still holds its own with contemporaries when it comes to adventure and experimentation.

From arpeggio odysseys to quirky dance tracks, this album has a lot to offer. Though it may not be the most cohesive thing on the block, it's still an engaging listen.

If you gave a listen to this album, what did you think of it? Love it? Hate it? Why?
