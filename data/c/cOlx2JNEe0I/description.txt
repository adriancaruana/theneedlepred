While Vessel does create a pretty consistent and well-groomed style on this album, which fuses elements of IDM and techno with some of the most shadowy sounds on record, some tracks are clearly more well-developed than others.  

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
