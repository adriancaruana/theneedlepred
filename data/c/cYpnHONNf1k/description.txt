Tom Waits' latest album, rather than showing a new side to the eccentric singer-songwriter, it somewhat of a retrospective, revisiting the numerous sounds that have made this guy so "bad" for all these years.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

7/10
