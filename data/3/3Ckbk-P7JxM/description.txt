With some classic heavy metal riffage, Darkthrone comes out with their most old school album yet, which I'm sure will be a thrill to some metal fans--even if the cartoony vocals seem to poke fun at heavy metal stereotypes a bit.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
