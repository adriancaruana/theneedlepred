This latest track from Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti has got me extremely excited for the upcoming album on 4AD. Let's just hope we're not in for another Tomorrow, In A Year. The production on this track makes it extremely surreal, coming off like a lost disco jam full of eccentric vocals. The verse is soft and sensual, but Pink kicks down the walls and raises his hands to heaven for the chorus. It's worth clapping along to, I think. Great sounds, melodies, and structure. A hot jam!
