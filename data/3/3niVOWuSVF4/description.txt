Ariel Pink w/Added Pizazz: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=148

On her full-length debut, Janelle Monae doesn't just hit out of the park. She goes all Dragon Ball Z and wallops it with the force of a thousand super saiyans. All animae references aside, this thing is great for dozens of reasons: immediate, conceptual, varied, and engaging. There's not a moment where I felt underwhelmed. The most out-of-place track has to be the Of Montreal collaboration on "Make the Bus," which isn't doing too much for me. Outside of that, I can't really say anything bad about this album. It's a revival of jazz, funk, and motown fundamentals with a contemporary kick.
