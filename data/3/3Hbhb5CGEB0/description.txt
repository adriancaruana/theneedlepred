LCD Soundsystem's third and final album is an ambitious trip into the sounds of dance and rock fusion. A lot of strong influences coming from the 70s and 80s on this one--especially from the realms of post-punk, disco, and new wave. I already have an affinity for this music, so it was fantastic to hear a modern band just do it right. LCD has really built upon a classic sound this time around; bringing a style back with sincerity, and putting their own spin on it, too. Great songs, melodies, lyrics, and grooves. Hardly a scratch on this thing. I felt a little underwhelmed by one track, and I'm happy that's my biggest complaint. I can hardly nit pick on this thing.

What do you think about this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?
