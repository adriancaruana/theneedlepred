Daniel Lopatin's latest full-length sees him stepping away from the extreme sampling that made 2011's Replica so thrilling. Instead, he rests on his passion for tightly sequenced synths, and there are some somewhat engaging results.

Also, I said "Chrome County" instead of "Chrome Country" when mentioning the closing track of this album like a fool. I'm sorry. :-S

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
