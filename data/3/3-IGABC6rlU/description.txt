PJ Harvey's latest album is easily one of her most accessible and cohesive. The lyrics are loaded with political ammunition, dealing with every from war to England as an institution. Imagery of soldiers and deformed children make it a pretty dark listen, and the production only enhances the experience.

From beginning to end, the sparse drums and watery guitars make the songs stand out. For the most part, the instrumentation is pretty simple, but it's a nice surprise when a horn, some strings, or backup vocals show up to play. 

All in all, I think it's one of her most accessible moments yet. Strong songs, creative production, and a distinct personality. Loving it.

What should I review next, eh? What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?

8/10
