Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti have come up with their cleanest-sounding album with Before Today. Pink's obsession with new wave, glam rock, disco, and post-punk continues as usual, but the strange, surreal recording tricks crowding his earlier work aren't as prevalent.

Though the songs are still great--really great, in fact--longtime fans may be a little disheartened by the overall lack of "weirdness." Many of these tracks are simply reworked versions of "classic" songs from the Haunted Graffiti discography, so Before Today may not be much of anything new for some; but the cleaner, more accessible approach will surely blow the minds of some first-timers.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?
