Crystal Castles' "Not In Love" ft. Robert Smith is an electrifying re-reinvention of the Canadian new wave hit, which was originally performed by Platinum Blonde. 

The track starts with some cold synths and robotic loops, and bring some nice percussion to the table, too. Robert Smith's vocals, on the other hand, are much warmer and overly emotional; making the song seem a lot less sequenced than it really is. The chorus is a fantastic explosion of color and effects that really makes this thing a standout piece of production.

Pound for pound, it's an amazing cover, and I can't say enough good things about it. I can't wait for the physical version of this to drop in December.

What do you think of this track? Fantastic? Not so much? Why? And what should I review next?

9/10
