On Baths debut LP, we've got enough colorful beats to smother a chillwave producer. Dreamy synths, sharp snares, and sweet vocals make this album a pretty easygoing experience. It's undeniably instant, but there's a lot to learn from repeated listens. There's a lot of detail in the production, added with unexplainable noises, pianos, and faint keyboards.

There were a few moments I didn't care for, which I attribute to the falsetto vox, but I've got to give credit where it's due. This LP is creative, engaging, and fun. What did you think of this album, though?
