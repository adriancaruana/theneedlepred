Brainfeeder's Gaslamp Killer embarks on his most ambitious project yet, delivering an album worth of tracks that features an array of glitchy and textured hip hop instrumentals that feature an array of sounds, styles, and musical guests. 

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
