Purity Ring's approach to synth pop on Shrines blurs the line that separates dark and cute. While it brings the new LP some unique qualities, the overall experience of these eleven tracks is a bit one-dimensional.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
