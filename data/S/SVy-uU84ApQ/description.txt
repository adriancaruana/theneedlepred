Theophilus London's new EP, Lover's Holiday, is a piece of pop rap I can really get down with. Not only are some strong new wave influences tastefully shown on off this thing, but the songwriting is crafted for maximum enjoyability.

With strong melodies, beats, and guest singers, Theo has set a serious bar for himself when his next full-length drops later this year. Outperforming singles like "Flying Overseas" is going to be a tough thing to do.

Overall, these songs are rich with hooks, melody, and personality. I kind of get the feeling the this guy might be bordering on being a little too "cool" for my ears, but it's nothing I can't handle.

What do you think about this EP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
