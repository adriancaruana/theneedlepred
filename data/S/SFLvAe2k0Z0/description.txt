This album is a lot less heavy than HOF's previous efforts. In fact, you could say it's a little slim by doom metal standards; however, HOF haven't missed out on the raw intensity that makes their music so great. This album doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it's still a consistent release from a respected band. Great drums, rippin' solos, fierce vocals, and ambitious song structures.
