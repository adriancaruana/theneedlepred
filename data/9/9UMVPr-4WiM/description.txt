With Numbers, Mellowhype manages to churn out a few decent beats, but the lyrical content and originality are more lacking than ever. It seems making an interesting hip hop record is not in Mellowhype's career itinerary. Instead, portraying the forgettable fantasies of that "cool kid with a c average" is more important.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
