On Villagers full-length debut, singer-songwriter Conor O'Brien strings some great songs together, but he makes little to no effort to stop them from drowning in his influences. He slathers the music in some impressive arrangements, but ends a few tracks with some conceptual abruptness that doesn't really add anything to the music. 

O'Brien sounded much more natural on his debut EP under the Villagers name, but this album still brings a lot of impressive production if that's what you're looking for.

What do you think of this release? Love it? Hate it? Why? How would you score it?
