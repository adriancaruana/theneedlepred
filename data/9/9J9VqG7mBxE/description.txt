When it comes to garage rock, it doesn't get more gray and dreary than the Fresh & Onlys' Play It Strange. It's a spectral album of songs that relies more on its sound than its songwriting. And that wouldn't be a bad thing if there was just a little more variety on this album.

After the first several tracks, the opaque vocals and country twang start to take their toll and make me feel as if Play It Strange is a never-ending hedge maze where every turn looks like the one before it.

I didn't dig the LP that much, but hopefully one of y'all will.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? Fav track? Fav Fresh & Only's album?

4/10
