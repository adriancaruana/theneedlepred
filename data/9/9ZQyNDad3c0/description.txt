The Gaslamp Killer brings some fantastic tracks to his latest EP, Death Gate, and really shows off his flare for producing. There's no reason to think this guy is going to live in the shadow of A Sufi and a Killer fame; plus, if any producer-DJ is going to give Flying Lotus a run for his money in the near future, it's this guy.

The major issue with Death Gate is it rarely keeps up a good pace for more than a minute and thirty seconds before it goes into an interlude or just ends. But that's kinda the nature of this thing since it's an EP. There's still a great feat. track w/Gonjasufi and a must-hear, 6-minute monster titled "Shattering Inner Journeys."

Though it's not making the loved list, there's still a lot to love about it. I'm excited to hear this guy's future output.

What do you think of this EP and the songs on it? What do you think of the Gaslamp Killer and the Brainfeeder label? Where is hip hop going these days? Why?
