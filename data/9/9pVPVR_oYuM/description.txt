Black Mountain's latest LP doesn't carry on the prog-influences their last album endorsed. Instead, it's a pretty detour into the sounds of classic and folk rock.

I like that the band is changing things up, but they've come out sounding a little tame in the process. A little bit of adventure never hurt anybody, but I could understand the band wanting to make a more accessible record. It's just not accessing me as much, that's all.

What do you think of this LP? Hmmm. Loving it? Hating it? What do you think of the band's previous work?

6/10
