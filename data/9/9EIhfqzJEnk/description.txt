The Souljazz Orchestra's new album doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does revive some important musical roots. The sounds of Latin music, afrobeat, and jazz-funk flow throughout this album, and blend to the point where it's hard to tell where one starts and the other ends. 

The recording sounds great, the musicianship is spectacular, and the interplay brings up images of a well-oiled machine. If you consider yourself a jazz fiend, this won't blow you away; however, it's definitely impressive to hear a modern band playing music like this with so much passion.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
