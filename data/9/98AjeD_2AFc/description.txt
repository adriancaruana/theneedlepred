Laura Marlin's Once I Was An Eagle shows the British singer-songwriter moving even further away from her folk pop roots, and embracing a moodier sound. Not only that, but Laura's battles with love seem to take center stage as this album's prime subject matter.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
