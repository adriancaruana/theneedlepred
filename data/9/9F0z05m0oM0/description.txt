This new P.O.S record will probably please a lot of fans. Stefon did work to groom his style, and bring a succinct set of tracks that are easy to take in, but a lot of the instrumentals here--outside of "Bumper" and "Fire In the Hole / Arrow to the Action"--don't match the revolutionary attitude Stefon's lyrics portray.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
