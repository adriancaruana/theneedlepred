It pains me to say it, but I don't care for this new SZA record at all. Not just because some of the tunes are unmemorable, but her own vocal guests just step all over her and these songs.

Thanks for Cakes Chuchesta for stopping by:

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
