Young Fathers' debut tape, Tape One, is as pretty fun, freaky, and lo-fi mix of hip hop. African music, and reggae. Though the release is only 20 minutes long, these tracks make up for it with lots of personality and catchy hooks.

What do you think of this ep / mixtape? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
