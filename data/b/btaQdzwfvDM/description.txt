Maserati's Pyramid of the Sun is a fantastic reinterpretation of the classic Krautrock sounds given to us by bands like Neu! and Tangerine Dream. Of course, this comes on the heels of a split the band released last year with he band Zombi, and it's all lead to Zombi member Steve Moore actually contributing quite a bit of synth work to this album.

The heavy production, keyboards, and extra melody makes this thing a huge improvement upon the sound the band forged on their 2007 album. If I were directing a fight scene in a huge action flick, this album would be my first pick for the soundtrack.

It's a great LP, but stops just short of amazing me. There are some points that could be drawn out a bit more, but I know a lotta people prefer their music to be more immediate than I do. If you think that's the case, jump on this album while you still can.

What do you think of this LP? Loving it? Hating it? Why?

7/10
