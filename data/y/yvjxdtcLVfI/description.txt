Last year's DR review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvPpOLp-8LM

Das Racist's Relax is a bit of a letdown for me. I just didn't enjoy it as much as the tapes. There are plenty of tracks here where the guys are their usual, hilarious selves. However, some of the funnier tracks lack the focus that make songs such as "Michael Jackson" such a hard-hitting experience. Not only that, but there are songs on here that feel, uh, normal.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

6/10
