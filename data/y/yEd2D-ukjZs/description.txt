On their third LP, Metronomy lowers their eccentric characteristics to a simmer and gives their songwriting strenghts a workout. The track list hits with one great tune after another. And even though the sounds behind these tracks might not be fantastic, the hooks and melodies are too good not to enjoy.

An enjoyable LP of light, airy dance tunes about love and a lackthereof. For some, it's just what the doctor ordered.

What do you think of this record? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

7/10
