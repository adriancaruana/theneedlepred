The Stooges' Raw Power is one of the most dangerous albums in rock. It makes guys like G.G. Allin look like a kitten, and that's no lie. Despite it's great songs, attitude, and approach, the LP as always suffered from mixing issues. It was originally mixed in '73 by Iggy Pop, but then by David Bowie after Legacy was unhappy with the original version. In '97, the album was remixed again, and Iggy was in charge this time around. The result was one of the most compressed, punishing musical experiences I've ever had. A lot of people got down on the distortion and the imperfections of that '97 version, but that sound was clearly the '73 intent when you compare it to the very first mixes, which were issued in '95 via a compilation titled Rough Power. Though I'm not a fan of the Bowie mix, because it's way too tinny and devoid of drums, it's still a piece of rock history. It's good that it not go completely into obscurity, but I still can't say it's the go-to place to hear the Stooges' real, raw power. I'm still a big fan of the Iggy version, and would like the guide all the new potential Stooges listeners to that particular release. Fans of the Bowie mix will find this remastered version pleasurable, and the live performances on this LP aren't bad, too. This edition is just more of a collector's item than an absolute interpretation, for me. 

If you haven't done it yet, listen to the Stooges. Their self-titled, Fun House, or the Iggy Pop remix of Raw Power are where it's at. 

Have you heard this LP? What do you think of it? Love the Stooges? Hate 'em? Why? Bowie mix vs. Iggy mix?
