On Civil Civic's new double b-side single, they break into some cleaner production and great textures. This is some highly visceral electrorock, with a blast of relentless fuzz that will leave your ears reeling in ecstacy. The tracks might not have hit me as hard as CC's first single, but they're both undeniably solid.

8/10 & 7/10
