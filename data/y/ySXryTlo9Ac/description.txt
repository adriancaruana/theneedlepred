Though it's not as riveting as their full-length debut with LP, Holy Fuck has some back with a record that sounds much more varied and mature. There's a huge step up with studio production on this album, bringing a lot more clarity into the fold. If only the band brought the extremely improvisational feel of LP to Latin, too. HF is clearly evolving, and this album is an interesting part of that process. Fun, colorful album with some nice replay power.

What do you think of this release? Love it? Hate it? Why?
