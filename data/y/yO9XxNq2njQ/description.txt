The more I listen to the soundtrack, the more it seems Daft Punk was a great choice for this soundtrack. With arranger Joseph Trapanese, they've pulled together some really impressive combinations of electronics and acoustics. The 85-piece chamber orchestra makes this thing sound larger than life itself.

My main problem is that I can't really see myself enjoying this score outside of the movie itself, which has nothing to do with it being "bad" or "mediocre." My main problem is that the music seems so tailored to the movie--take into consideration the many short song lengths and abrupt song endings--that it feels like something is missing when I'm listening simply to this.

Whether or not this is a great soundtrack won't truly be known until Tron: Legacy is released, and Daft Punk fans are able to see the sound and sights tie together. That's the point of a score, isn't it? It's supposed to enhance your visual experience.

What do you think of this soundtrack? What about other soundtracks? Are you happy Daft Punk did this? Is it weird that this movie is produced by Disney? Do you think Disney is gonna turn Tron: Legacy into Toy Story 3000?
