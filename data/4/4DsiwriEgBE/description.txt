Mogwai's latest album is a potent concentrate of the band's usual formula. Rather than varying in volume throughout a given song, the compositions here concentrate on adding more and more layers of guitars, keys, and effects as each song progresses. It's pretty krautrock of them if you ask me.

I enjoyed this thing a lot. It may not round all of the bases of "post-rock," but I'm fine with that. I've always known Mogwai to be a band that does whatever it wants, not satisfy the requirements of a certain style of music.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

8/10
