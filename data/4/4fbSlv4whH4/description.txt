Like Cut Copy's last single, the band has going back to the future in search of new sounds. This time, the band has come back with an arsenal of sounds from the new wave era. 

Quirky synths and a disco beat make this one a pretty pleasant listen, but it was hard for me to find anything that original or captivating out of it. I can't take its accessibility away from it, but I'm not accessing anything all that thrilling.

What did you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Why?

6/10
