This is a helluva collaboration right here. Hearing Bjork's vocals intertwined with that of Dirty Projectors makes me wonder why this didn't happen sooner. The fragile instrumentation on this mini-album doesn't live up to the high-end production on Bitte Orca, but it doesn't need to. The vocals are absolutely stunning--even if they aren't dressed up. The melodies and harmonies are absolutely gorgeous, and the time constraints put on Longstreth in the writing of this album has led to a batch of tracks that are surprisingly immediate. For those who have taken the 'Projectors as a difficult band may want to give this a listen.

It's a great collab, but who knows if its time will be kind to it. It might translate best to hardcore fans of these two musical acts, but that doesn't mean it's not of a high caliber.
