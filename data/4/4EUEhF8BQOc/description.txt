On H.A.M., Kanye West and Jay-Z come together like it's amateur hour over a cheap beat with even cheaper rhymes. I understood from the beginning that this upcoming album wasn't going to blow away the epic beats on MBDTF, but was it wrong of me to at least expect it to be decent?

Kanye and Jay-Z don't work together as much as they just do their own thing, which does nothing for the track overall. Though I've enjoyed both of these guys in their solo endeavors, what makes them getting together on this song so special? 

What do you think of this track? What should II review next?
