Cee Lo's third full-length is easily his most consistent and impressively produced. With an orchestra worth of instrumentation, Green chases after the classic soul sounds of Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield. And most of the time, he catches them.

With some looped drums and new studio sounds, he updates this timeless era of music, but it does get a little too clean and safe at times. There are a few tracks that just didn't do it for me, but there are still some clear standouts and winners. This LP definitely impresses beyond its slightly gimmicky single.

What do you guys think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
