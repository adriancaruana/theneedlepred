Klaxons sophomore LP is just way too much of a hulk to compliment the angular and nimble beats and structure shifts the band makes on this album. Though I do respect them for creating some pretty cosmic rock, this album just isn't meant for me. The idea of a grandiose, Muse-esque approach to dance rock sounds amazing on paper, but this particular execution of it doesn't impress me as much as I wanted it to.

What did you think of this album? How would you score it?

4/10
