"How Come You Never Go There" review: 
http://theneedledrop.com/2011/08/feist-home-come-you-never-go-there/

On her latest album, Metals, Canadian singer-songwriter Leslie Feist brings a set of songs that feel much older than the tracks that were on her last album, the Reminder. That album was released only four years ago, but Metals' dreary, grey aesthetic makes the distance between these two albums feel so much wider.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
