On Liars' fifth album, the band throws their music into the deepest, darkest, most serpent-filled hole they could possibly find. They create an alternate dimension where eerie sounds and dissonant intervals reign supreme. There are some lush strings, a spot of horns; but Sisterworld revolves mostly around the simplicity of normal rock instrumentation. Yet, it sounds so otherworldly. 

Overall, it lays on the tension a little too much, kind of making it difficult to enjoy. But it would be stupid to assume that wasn't the underlying intent. Though I wasn't able to enjoy that anxiety as much as some people may, I've still got to give kudos to these guys for turning another cohesive concept into an album.
