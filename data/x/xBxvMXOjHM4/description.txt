On Come Around Sundown, Kings of Leon have crafted their most accessible album yet. The guitars shimmer over loads of warm bass and Caleb's signature vocal delivery. It's all very well arranged and produced, but I can't help but feel like the band has dulled down what made them the individuals that excited fans on their first few albums.

The album art is beyond appropriate for this album, though: An easygoing sunset. This setting is a nice place to visit. It's a calming image, for sure. But staring into a sunset for over forty minutes has never been a major interest of mine. I do know, however, there are plenty of people that would appeal to.

What do you think of this record? Love it? Hate it? Is it too underwhelming? Maybe not calming enough? How do you think it shapes up to KOL's past albums?
