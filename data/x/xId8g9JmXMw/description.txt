This is the first track to leak from the Italian psych rock project Dumbo Gets Mad. While it's not the most distinctive garage I've ever heard, the production is extremely playful, and the songwriting is visceral as hell. Love the chimes, dirty drums, and fuzzy bass. Disney, please don't sue this dude.
