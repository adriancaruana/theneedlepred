On Iceage's full-length debut, the band forges a cohesive style in raw, messy musicianship and noisy guitars. Sometimes it's overwhelming, and sometimes it's just catchy and loveable. But it's always giving off some kind of strong energy or emotion--even at its most apathetic.

I need more sleep in my life.

What did yo u think of this album, eh? Also, what should I review next?
