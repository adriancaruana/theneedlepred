"You and I" Review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Eiy1V32zws

Washed Out's debut LP definitely brings a comparative change from the project's early EPs. I guess my issue is that the change just isn't enough to make me wanna stick with this album over previous efforts.

There are flashes of progression and ambition here and there, but tracks like "Eyes Be Closed" and "Echoes" seem to repeat old ideas and pump out great sounds without backing them with great songs.

So, as you can figure, I was a little underwhelmed at certain points of this album. But maybe there will be future releases from this project I'll like more. Washed out, we'll be in touch.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

6/10
