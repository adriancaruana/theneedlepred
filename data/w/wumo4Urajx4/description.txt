Electric Wizard's Black Masses is a psychedelic take on the band's classic formula of thick bass and heavy riffs. Some of these tracks are packed to the brim with electric guitar freakouts, phantom noises, and hidden drones; but other moments play it pretty straight, though.

The riffs can get a little nondescript, and a slightly muddy sound keeps Black Masses from becoming the powerhouse it should be.

It's a decent album, for sure. It just won't be the first I think of when the band's name comes to mind.

What did you think of this album? Did you love it? Hate it? Why? How does it compare with EW's earlier work? What should I review next?

6/10
