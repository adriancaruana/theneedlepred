On Settle, the fresh electronic music duo known as Disclosure brings a series of house and garage-inspired dance numbers that groove excitingly. Some of the vocal guests are pretty spectacular as well. Even if you're not nutty about dance music, give it a try.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
