No Age's latest effort, for me, pales in comparison to their previous EP and LP. However, it's not like this release isn't good. No Age is still the noisy, high-energy act they were several years ago; but they've toned things down a bit in favor of a little more clarity in the mix. Whether or not that actually lends the band more power on this release is up to you.

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why?

6/10
