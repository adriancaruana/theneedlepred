It's nice to hear Mark Ronson get back into the swing of creating original material, but this album has way to many lows to warrant stopping the presses. The singles on it are extremely memorable, and blend hip hop and pop with ease; however, diving deeper into the tracks reveal a lot of filler, failed experiments, and sameness.

It attempts to genre cross, but only does so on a very minute scale. It's enjoyable at moments, certainly, but it just doesn't go far enough to keep me interested.

If you're in the market for something light, sweet, and beat-loaded, this will probably be a decent grab. But don't be surprised if the singles set the bar higher than the rest of the album's tracks.

What did you think of this album? What do you think about Mark Ronson's work in general? Favorite song? Least favorite?  Why?

5/10
