On this new LP, Tobacco has arguably improved upon his sound, but is this new LP all that different from what we've heard from him and BMSR in the past? It's a decent album, with a lot of great songs, but I find myself cherry-picking some while throwing others at the wayside. It's a fun LP, and you shouldn't expect the world of it. Tobacco is sounding as sweet as ever, and highly recommend trying this stuff out if you haven't already.

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why?
