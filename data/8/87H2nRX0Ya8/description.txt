Track review of "Summer": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxvUaBMM8Xg&feature=fvst

Magic Kids' latest album is shamelessly corny, but that's what makes it so interesting. It's truly an enigma with its complex arrangements and non-stopped upbeat attitude. It's sad it's hitting ears at the end of the summer, because it might have made a killing at the beginning of it. 

Some of the songs are a little short, and not as developed, but this thing is still extremely impressive. It's a group of highly enjoyable pop vignettes.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why, why, why?!?!?!
