Matmos' latest LP is a collaboration with the NY percussion ensemble So Percussion. Together, these two outfits hit just about everything with everything else, creating plinks, plops, bangs, and booms that build up into a minimalist wall of quirky sounds and simple melodies. 

Though enticing sonically, this album is a little bland stylistically. It seems Matmos and So are content to just indulge in each others' favorite thing: sound. Though there are spots of acoustic guitar, keyboards, and horns that break things up, much of this stuff blends together a little bit into something that could use a little more variation.

I still highly recommend checking out Matmos if you are still yet to, and I'm hoping So Percussion starts a consistent solo career soon--as opposed to the many collaborations their career has thrived on thus far.

What do you think of this LP? Amazing? Not so amazing? Why do you feel that way about the album, eh?

6/10
