Cali rapper Hopsin has a tight flow and rhymes that don't mince words. While I like the more hard-hitting tracks on this new LP of his, there just aren't enough of them to balance out the sickening melodrama that happens on a great deal of this new LP's songs.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
