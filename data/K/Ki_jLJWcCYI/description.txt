Judging from tracks like "Gold Soul Theory," New York's the Underachievers certainly have style and vision; however, they don't display it on every single track on this new mixtape--which really does feel like a smattering of different sounds and messages. It's the spacier and more spiritual tracks that go over best, and I hope that's the angle that maintains the most strength as these guys work toward their next major project.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
