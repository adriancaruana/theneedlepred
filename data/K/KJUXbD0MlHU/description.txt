Black Milk may be a breath of fresh air from rap's mainstream, but he's nowhere near as innovative or interesting as his underground contemporaries--though he certainly does like to plug them all over this new album.

Generic beats, alright rhymes, and an almost anonymous flow should make this LP forgettable for just about any rap aficionado. It's not the most awful thing on the planet, and there are definitely some worthwhile moments; however, my ears are better off elsewhere.

4/10
