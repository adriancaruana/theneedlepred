Active Child's sophomore release has some pretty haunting and beautiful sounds. Lone member Pat Grossi's choir boy falsetto is undeniably good. Plus, all the effects he laces into these tracks makes this LP an interesting listen.

While I'm not in love with every song on this LP, the sounds are stellar. In my opinion, what's best are the couple tracks where Active Child embraces the sound of experimental R&B. That's an idea I'd love to hear explored further.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
