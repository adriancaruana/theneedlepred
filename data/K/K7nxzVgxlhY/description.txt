"Drunk Girls" comes from LCD Soundsystem's upcoming album, This Is happening, and it's an incredibly promising single. It's weird, comedic, and looking for someone to dance with--preferably a drunk girl, but I don't think it's picky. The track isn't incredibly detailed, but it's got some great production and a load of energy. I'm digging it heavy, and really looking forward to the new LP.

What do you think of the track? Love it? Hate it? Why?

Also, did you happen to notice I'm in a freaking record store? Record store day is tomorrow, folks. On 4/17, are you gonna hit up your local recstore? If so, what one are you heading to?
