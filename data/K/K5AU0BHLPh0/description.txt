On this title track from one of Grouper's two new albums, Liz Harris creates "vastness," and packs it into three minutes of arpeggios and ghostly vocals. The lo-fi production makes the music really smudgy and obscured, but there's still something therapeutic about the repetition and textures here.

Listening to this is a lot like walking through a foggy graveyard, or floating slowly atop a body of water on a starry night. It's not music I could really dissect in the same way I review most albums on this channel. For an album such as this, I need to lie down and wait to float away on an ambient cloud.

What do you think of this track? What do you think of Grouper's music in general? Are you a fan of ambient music? Are you a fan of soundscapes? Are you a fan of "dream pop"? Should artists put out more double albums? triple albums?

7/10
