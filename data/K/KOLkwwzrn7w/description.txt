Kid Cudi's latest album has plenty of great production and a strong narrative running throughout. Like Janelle Monae's the ArchAndroid, it's extremely conceptual and blends hip hop with numerous generes. 

There's a lot of personal struggle and triumph on this album, but I can't say Kudi's personality is bright enough here to get me feeling as if I've got a stake in it all. I feel more like an outsider observing the those little battles people fight day by day.

What's painful to one person can be even more painful to another. I understand that; however, it's just hard for me to connect with this album on an emotional level. I'm impressed by the melodies and the beats, but I haven't been truly sucked in.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What album should I review next? What would you score this LP? Favorite track?

6/10
