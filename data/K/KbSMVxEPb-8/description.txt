While the dreamy, guitar-driven indie pop of Beach Fossils wasn't impressing me when the band's music blew up on the blog-o-sphere several years ago, Clash The Truth is proof that some sounds just need time to develop.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
