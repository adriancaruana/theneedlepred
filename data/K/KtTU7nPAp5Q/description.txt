Toro Y Moi's latest LP is a noticeable improvement compared to the sketchbook of ideas that made up his last album, Causers of this. Underneath the Pine is loaded with light, pretty arrangements and dancey disco beats. The songwriting and vocals aren't always standout, though.

While the whole album may not feel standout, it's a nice and easygoing experience, for sure. Great for soundtracking a small get together or an all-night sexcapade.

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

6/10
