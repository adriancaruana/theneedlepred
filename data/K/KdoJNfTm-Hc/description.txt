Brandon Flowers' latest single is the stuff Americana's anthemic ballads are made of. Lyrics about easy-to-relate subjects like heaven and hell, and plenty of guitar melody-packed hooks. 

If you're in love with the single, I'd encourage you to jump head first into this album. Chances are, it won't disappoint. It'll have little to no potholes for someone who loves this style of music.

What do you think of this track, though? Awesome? Not so awesome? Did the hook get ya?
