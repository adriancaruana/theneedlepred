On M83's latest album, indie dance and synth pop sounds are pumped up and glossed out until they reach almost unrealistic proportions. Not only that, but these ideas are stretched out to a double album length.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

4/10
