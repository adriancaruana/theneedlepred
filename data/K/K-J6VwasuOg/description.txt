On Fucked Up's new album, the band brings concept to the forefront for a group of songs that tell a dramatic tale of love and loss. It's pretty, well, complicated.

As "epic" as this story is, what makes it grandiose also kinda kills it for me, too. These songs make use of punk's trademark aggression and speed, but draws all the intensity out to a point where it no longer feels energetic, thrilling, cathartic, or any of the other things I look to this style of music for.

Which leads me to believe that it's just not for me. Maybe some of the more melodic moments could have gone over better if the vocals displayed as much dynamics, but the recording, instrumentation, and message are all pretty good.

For any punk fan, love it or hate it, it's at least worth a visit. 

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? And what should I review next?

5/10
