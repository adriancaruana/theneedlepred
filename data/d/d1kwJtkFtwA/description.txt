Between the basic flows, uninteresting lyricism, and ridiculous "singing" that's barely masked by the auto-tune it's slathered in, I'm honestly not finding much of anything to like about the new Future record. The beats are decent sometimes...

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
