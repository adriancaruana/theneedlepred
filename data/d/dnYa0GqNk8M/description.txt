Track review from May: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/05/africa-hitech-gangslap/

It took a while for Africa Hitech's debut LP to grow on me. When the album originally came out in May, I took some favorites from it, but dismissed the rest as being too hectic to be really enjoyable.

However, I found myself just itching to listen to this thing again at the beginning of this month. To my surprise, I ended up loving the album from front to back. I still think some of the sounds could have been mixed a little better, but I love the rigid and primal mix of African and electronic sounds that flow throughout this LP. This isn't your average fusion of these two worlds, believe me.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
