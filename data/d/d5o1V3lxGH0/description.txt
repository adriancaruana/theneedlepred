On their latest LP, the Strokes want to head in a new direction, but they can't decide on one. So they use every track to obtain a different sound. Moments like "Under Cover of Darkness" embrace what's best about the band's past work, but "Two Kinds of Happiness" shoots for a sound most would probably associate with the 80s.

Though it's kinda all over the place, most of the songs here are quite good. Maybe the band is exploring new territory since this is the first album after their hiatus.

As long as they're writing good tunes, I'll be listening.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
