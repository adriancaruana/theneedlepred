With Alphaville, Imperial Triumphant upholds its blend of extreme metal and jazz without sounding like a novelty.

Note: Sorry for not recognizing tracks 8 and 9 as bonus covers. They aren't labeled on some platforms, but I should've expected the unexpected from this band. Normally I don't take bonus tracks into account, but at least these two (despite arguably being the album's weakest) didn't detract very much from the experience. "City Swine" is still kind of a dud for me, and while I enjoy "The Greater Good," in my opinion it doesn't make for the best closer either. But again, sorry for the oversight.
