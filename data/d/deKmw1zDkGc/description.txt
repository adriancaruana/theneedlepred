Every time a Kills album comes on, I feel a bunch of involuntary reflexes coming on: my eyes squint, my lips tighten, and my shoulders start to shrug. I'm just unsure of why this music should appeal to me. I could certainly see myself latching onto the noisy distortion, stuttering guitar effects, and garage rock style this LP has to offer. But at the end of the day, I keep turning away because of the moody icing this album is slathered in. That and the songwriting doesn't blow my mind, I guess. Maybe I'll never be a Kills fan. Makes me sad.

What do you think of this album? Do you love the Kills? Hate 'em? Why? What does this album sound like to you? What should I review next?
