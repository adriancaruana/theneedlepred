This new Dead In the Dirt album features a fantastically heavy mix, making it some of the most pummeling grindcore and powerviolence you'll hear this year--even if a number of tracks here come off as slightly unmemorable.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
