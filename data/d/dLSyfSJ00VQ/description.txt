With tracks like "Minotaur" teasing toward its release, I thought Floating Coffin would be a catchy, energetic, and colorful garage rock record. Rather than follow suit, many other tracks on this LP riff endlessly with unadventurous guitars and uninspiring song structures.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
