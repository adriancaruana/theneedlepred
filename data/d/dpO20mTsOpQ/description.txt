While this new Avey Tare record has some sweet melodies on it, nearly every piece of instrumentation on this thing is burnt to a crisp with effects. A lot like the latest Animal Collective record, this album is a little overdone, and could have benefited from taking the more orthodox approach the "Little Fang" single did.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
