On their debut EP, Superhumanoids crafts a definitive sound and reworks a few old demos. These six tracks should be real attention-grabbers for the krautrock crowd. The linear, minimalist approach of Superhumanoids' rock is clean, sanitary, and straightforward. They might be one of the most no-nonsense bands you'll hear this year. 

Seek this out if you're in the market for breezy synths, sweet melodies, and songs you can just get lost in. Give it a listen via the link above and tell me what you think. Woot!
