It's hard to believe the three tracks on this Rival Dealer EP are actually Burial tracks, because they bring the UK-based producer's sound in a such a different direction. We're not getting moody, skeletal dubstep tunes on this one, people. Get ready for some auto-tuned synth pop with a boatload of atmosphere.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
