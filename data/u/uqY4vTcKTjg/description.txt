On their first album in six years, Autolux enhances the experimental sounds they forged on 2004's Future Present. Tracks like Audience No. 2 bring are a real sensory overload, packing the mix with distortion and effects. But the album has a few severe potholes that leave me underwhelmed. Whether it's looping instrumentation or a lack of interesting sounds, some tracks just leave me cold and uninterested. It's nice if you're looking for a friendlier face in this style of music, but I'd rather hear the dangerous side I've come to appreciate from Autolux.
