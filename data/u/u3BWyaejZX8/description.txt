While the third installment of Oranssi Pazuzu's psychedelic approach to black metal isn't bad, the band doesn't venture into territory any more exciting than what they delivered on their debut album--even though some of the band's longest material yet sits on this new LP.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
