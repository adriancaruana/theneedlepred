With Honor Found In Decay, Neurosis releases one of its most straightforward albums yet, forgoing some of the more ambitious instrumentation that's made it onto past albums in favor of a sound that blends the heavy sounds of sludge with a bit of folk simplicity.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
