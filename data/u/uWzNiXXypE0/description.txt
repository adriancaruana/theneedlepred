Fleet Foxes' latest song is an epic tease  toward their sophomore album. Not only is the production fantastic, but the song structure and lyrics show a lot of ambition--even though they deal with the fear of being a small fish in a big pond.

If all the songs on this album are like this, we'll be in for a helluva album!

What do you think of this song? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next? What do you think of Fleet Foxes' first album? Will this LP be better?

8/10
