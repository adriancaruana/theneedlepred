With the Electric Lady, singer-songwriter and composer Janelle Mon√°e adds two more suites to her ongoing metropolis series. This time, she seems to embrace her classic influences in the worlds of R&B and soul closer than ever.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
