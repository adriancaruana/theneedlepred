On their latest album, Black Dice produces one of the most intelligible bodies of work to sit in the Brooklyn Group's discography. But even though it's surprisingly accessible for music this experimental, it stops a bit short of being interesting to me.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, too?
