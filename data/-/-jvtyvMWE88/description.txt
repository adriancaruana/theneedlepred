On the Cool Kids' full-length debut, When Fish Ride Bicycles, the Chicago duo pulls together some impressive beats and features. The great beats are to be expected, but things really deteriorate in the rapping and lyricism departments.

I know it's band to simply get hung up over the lyricism of this album, but it's really holding me back on this one. I know the Kids' earlier stuff wasn't the most lyrical material on the planet, but When Fish Ride is really an album for people who don't listen much to the lyrics. 

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, too? How are you doing today?
