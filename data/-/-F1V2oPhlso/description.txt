On Fashawn's latest mixtape, the Fresno rapper sounds as hungry as ever. He sounds fucking alive. He doesn't come off fake either. 

There's over an hour of material, and some of it seems a little half-baked--and I'm not talking about the weed references. But it's a FREE freakin' album. Though it may not be the most consistent thing in the world, listen in and pull some favorite tracks off of it. The tracks here I love, I REALLY freakin' love. 

The score is basically a reflection of how much I found myself skipping around, really. I'm excited for Fashawn's future in rap, and I think he's gonna release a fantastic new LP soon. I'm banking on it.

But don't listen to me. Listen to this mixtape yourself with the link at the top of this box.

What should I review next? What do you think of this mixtape? Love it? hate it? Why?
