(As of right now, NPR Music has a stream of this album up.) Ratatat's LP4 isn't the strongest piece of evolution in the duo's canon, but they're arguably doing what they do better than ever. Tons of great grooves, color, arrangements, and instrumentation, here. There's a lot more bravery in the song structures, too. Some naysayers might say this album is a copy of a copy, but I think it's more of a well-developed variation on the same Ratatat theme.
