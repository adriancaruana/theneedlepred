Arcade Fire review: http://bit.ly/9ZKqry

On their fifteenth studio album, Iron Maiden has refined the progressive elements they relied on with 2006's A Matter of Life and Death. Many of the intros and instrumental passages are drawn out, but they add more to the songs than they take away. My biggest issue with the album is Bruce's voice. It's really the only part of the band that shows any age. He can't hit the highs like he used to. And though the strain is only apparent on a handful of tracks, the spots where it does show up are ruined. Examples include bits of "Mother of Mercy" and "Starblind." There are even points where Bruce runs himself breathless by writing more lyrics than he can chew.

All that aside, the songwriting is still catchy and detailed. The production could certainly be better, but there's still a love of exploration and adventure in this band's songwriting; plus, Maiden is easily the best-looking when it comes to their contemporaries. I'd rather listen to this 40 times before I listen to a new Ozzy album once, that's for sure. 

The band is still kicking and still relevant. 

What did you think of this record, though? Love it? Hate it? Why?
