On "the Rose With the Broken Neck," Danger Mouse & Daniele Luppi pull together some Italian-style soundtrack music with Jack White on vocals. Though the textures and sounds are vintage and pretty authentic, the drama of this track--the drama I imagine should be here--doesn't really hit me. The same goes for the other tracks as well. 

The level of romance and passion on the music that influences this album is sky-high, but this feels more like a barren wasteland of pretended emotions. 

What do you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?

3/10
