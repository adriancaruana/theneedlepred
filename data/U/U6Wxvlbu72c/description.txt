Happy Birthday's debut album is fun enough to deserve some attention, but maybe it needs to get down to business and pop out a few more pop gems like "Girls FM" and "I Want To Stay." There's a great meld of psych, punk, and garage rock here that has me thinking of bands like Dum Dum Girls, Jay Reatard, and even the Unicorns.

I think HB is on the verge of garage greatness, but I can't say more than that. I don't see why this LP wouldn't earn them a devoted cult following, but I'm gonna wait a bit more before I blow out the candles.

Have you heard this band? Their songs? This album? Did you like it? Hate it? Why?
