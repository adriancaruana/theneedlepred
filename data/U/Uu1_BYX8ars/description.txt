Big Blood's latest album isn't the most consistent, but it's sounds are still extremely haunting and odd. It's a psychedelic and experimental approach to folk music--with a hint of drone added in for good measure, of course.

If you're into strange vocals, eerie melodies, and linear song structures, then get with this thing. You've got nothing to lose. It's free.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? Do you like folk music? Do you like psych music? Should I review the new Gorillaz next?

7/10
