This new compilation CD from Black Tambourine covers all of this short-lived band's recordings. For two years, this DC outfit blended their love of Phil Spector and the UK's shoegaze movement into a unique brand of noise pop. It's weird to hear such sweet, haunting songs nailed onto a harsh wall of distortion, but that's what made Black Tambourine Black Tambourine. Though these guys never hit it big--and probably never will--they're undoubtedly a big deal to bands like Vivian Girls, Dum Dum Girls, and The Pains of Being Pure at Heart. If those bands are topping your Last.fm charts or getting a lot of replays on your MP3 player, then Black Tambourine should be your next musical destination, for sure. Even if they don't win you over completely, their obscure place in American independent rock history is something to appreciate.
