On his full-length debut, 2 Chainz embraces a popular, trunk-knocking, and Southern sound, but doesn't supply much in the way of lyrics, personality, or entertainment.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

Some of the most notably cringe-worthy lyrics from this album:

Known to act a donkey on the camel toe
Then take the camel toe and turn it into casserole

Former Posturepedic I was slept on
So many chains on it look like my neck gone

Rev your mirror, shake it like a stipper ho!
Car so big it got a stripper pole

Going so hard you'd think I mixed a Viagra with a Soda

That pussy so good I miss ya, head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese like I'm taking pictures

She got a big booty so I call her Big Booty
Scrr..Scrr.. Wrists moving, cookin' to it

I am so high...attic
I am so high like an...addict

Got a move that will break your leg, know what I'm talking about
Known to kill pussy, nigga chalk it out

2 gun bang
And I'm so fly I can sue an airplane

Commas in my bank account
So much money I had to let the banker count
