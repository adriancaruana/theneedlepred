Big Ups' Eighteen Hours of Static combines numerous styles of underground rock music to create one of the most cutting, satirical rock records of this year. Think Minor Threat, Slint, D.R.I., and Dead Milkmen coming to a fantastic compromise on a collaborative album.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
