On the Books' latest release, the duo creates an emotional roller coaster of outlandish vocals samples and various musical styles. This thing is all over the place, but believe me when I say that's a good thing. There's a ton of vision behind this album; and despite all of its weirdness, it's still highly accessible. It's one of the most engaging listens I've had all year.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?
