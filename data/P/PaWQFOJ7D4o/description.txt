Despite a bit of genre-hopping, Machinedrum's latest album, Room(s), comes together quite nicely. There are moments tracks influenced by the world of wonky hip hop instrumentals--you know, the kinda stuff Brainfeeder drops on a regular basis--which is something this guys has always had a soft spot for.

But Machinedrum is very good about appealing to the winds of change whenever possible. And now that the sounds of dubstep and future garage are hot, he's trying his hand at recreating the sounds have have made names for guys like Burial. I'm sure it's something that will get his guy called a rip-off, but these emulations are when this album sounds best, truthfully.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
