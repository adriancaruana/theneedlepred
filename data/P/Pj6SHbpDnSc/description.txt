Earth's first installment of Angels of Darkness, Demons of light is a hefty dose of the same medicine they've been feeding us since Hex in '05. When it comes to concocting musical sedatives, Earth's receptive is still pretty potent; however, I'm having trouble calling this LP as interesting as its predecessor. 

The most noticeable change this time around is some longer song lengths and a lot of bowed instrumentation. Of course, I'm a fan of the cello, but the production here doesn't exactly find a flattering place for it in the mix. Instead, it seems jammed in a spot that makes the guitar and bass stand out significantly less, which is really why I came to this showdown in the first place.

It's still dark and moody music. I'm just feeling a little less magic this time around. Maybe the sequel will be better.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
