On Cage the Elephant's new album, the band spends more time copying than they do creating. Song after song, the band shows they've spent a lot of time studying the 90s. From post-hardcore to Pixies-esque alternative rock, there is a lot of history here. The problem is Cage the Elephant almost sounds unmistakably like some of these bands and tunes when they're playing. Yes, they play really well together, and the recording here is great; however, there's a serious identity crisis pervading this album throughout. This LP can definitely be a decent listen from a band who is undeniably enthusiastic, but I'm still left wondering who exactly this band is that's drowning in their influences.

What do you think of this band? What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?
