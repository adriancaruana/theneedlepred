Montreal's Ought displays a pretty wide set of influences on this debut record of theirs, including experimental folk rock to tracks that blend sounds of Midwest emo with the dismal emotions of bands like Slint. 

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
