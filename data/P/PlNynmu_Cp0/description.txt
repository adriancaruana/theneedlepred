On Jonsi's solo debut, the Icelandic singer and guitarist explores numerous sides of his musical psyche. There are tight, full, lush tracks with a really immediate feel. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are some really atmospheric tracks that take their time building. Though each moment is just as creative as the next, Go does suffer from some stylistic inconsistency. Whether or not you like this LP is really gonna be based on how well you can keep up with Jonsi as he jumps from one sound to the other. I find myself favoring the slower tracks, but I'm positive there will be people who feel otherwise. If you can keep up with all the shifts this album makes, all the more power to you.
