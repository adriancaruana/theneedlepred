Nicolas Jaar's debut LP is a dark exercise in bleak dance beats, sound collages, and ambient interludes. Though the album doesn't come off with a clear intent, Space Is Only Noise makes for a really heady and beautiful listen.

What makes this album attractive isn't exactly obvious in the first few listens--mostly because it's littered with so much experimentation--but the eventual growth is worth the wait time.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? What should I review next? Can you suggest an album that's not Radiohead's King of Limbs? I bet you can't.
