The new British Sea Power's fifth album is a rock record. That's it. Yes, BSP brings a lot of ambition to the table with anthemic guitar solos, gargantuan washes of reverb, and arranged instrumentation; however, it's the songwriting that hits the hardest. The hooks here are catchier than what the band was doing on DYLRM?, and a lot more refined, too--if you don't mind me saying.

I don't know if this LP will break the stigma some people have with this band, but I see no reason not to check it out if you call yourself a rock fan. To me, this is the album DYLRM? should have been.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? What do you think of British Sea Power? What should I review next? Is naval prowess really all that important in modern warfare? Should I hate Cal Chuchesta?
