Step Brothers' Lord Steppington is a great mixed bag of chill flows set against b-a-n-g-i-n-g beats. Even the more subdued instrumentals bring heat. While some tracks pale in comparison to others, there's a lot to love here.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
