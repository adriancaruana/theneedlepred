Though Mumford & Sons continue to be one of the least adventurous bands in folk music, what the band does with their tunes and regal combination of horns and strings is pretty sweet on the ears and comforting. A likable sophomore release.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
