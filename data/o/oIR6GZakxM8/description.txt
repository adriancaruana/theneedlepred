When it comes to choosing a direction, Seattle's Master Musicians of Bukkake have a little bit of musical ADD. That's fine, though. Most of the time--no matter what style these seven guys happen to be embracing--they always put a ton of heart and creativity into what they're doing. 

Some tracks on this third installment in the Totem series create dark soundscapes, and others feel like seeing a rebel group of desert guitarists play the kind of heavy psych rock bands like Tinariwen are known for popularizing.

While I don't mind this album being all over the place, there are some experiments here that don't impact me as much as others. It's pretty solid, and worth a visit for any experimental music fanatic. Go on an adventure, seriously.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

7/10
