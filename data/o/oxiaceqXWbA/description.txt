On this followup to Plastic Beach, Gorillaz bring together some pretty rough ideas and simple demos. Given, the sounds here are much better than what most people can create on a MacBook--never mind an iPad.

However, is it up to the level of quality and pizazz most Gorillaz albums are? I wouldn't say so.

It's hard for me to see this album as being more than just for the fans. If you've followed the band to this point, there's no reason you shouldn't explore this corner of Damon Albarn's musical mind, too. 

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Do you like it more than Plastic Beach? Less? Why?

5/10
