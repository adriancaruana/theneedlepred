My previous Foxygen review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NImDLA14kHs

This time around, the singer-songwriter duo known as Foxygen writes an album with much more focus and cohesion than 2011's Take the Kids off Broadway. 21st Century Ambassadors is simply one neatly crafted retro pop jam after another.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
