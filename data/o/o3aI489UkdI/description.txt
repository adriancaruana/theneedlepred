Cake is back at it again with a new album of songs that tell odd tales and hit hard grooves. If you've heard any of the bands previous stuff, this won't be a surprise. However, this could be both a good and bad thing.

If you've loved Cake's sound for the past five albums, there's no reason not to check this thing out; however, it's easy to initially cast this album away for almost sounding too much like its predecessors. 

Cake could have worked harder to refrain from traveling over their old footprints, but they can still write a great hook and catchy riffs.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?

7/10
