Teebs new album is a potent mix of relaxing, beat-powered soundscapes. For me, it came off a little uneventful at times, but this album isn't meant to jump out at you. It's more of a soundtrack for a long, relaxing moment.

It's extremely cohesive and sound-rich. If bringing beat music to a higher level is what gets you going, this is worth your time.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?

6/10
