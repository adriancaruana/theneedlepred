On Dark Time Sunshine's latest LP, the abstract hip hop duo takes its Aesop Rock-inspired style and adds some blissful production into the equation. It kinda like the Postal Service of hip hop albums. Maybe you'll like it! Check it out, my son.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
