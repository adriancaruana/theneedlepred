Tera Melos' new album is both a complex and accessible step away from their Untitled LP. The hooks are more memorable, and the crystal clear recording quality is a fantastic compliment to the music; making every noodly riff very readable. It's relentless, but it has its moments of resolve. It's technical, but it has its moments of simplicity. 

Despite all there is to like, I'm not heavily into this album. That because this music sits in an awkward spot for me. It's somewhat catchy and it's somewhat intense. If I'm looking for intensity, I'll shoot for something like Hella or Little Women. If I want something catchy, I'll go straight for Weezer; not some middle-ground. However, this is only my mindset.

So take my score and feelings toward this album with a grain of salt. It's pretty entertaining, and I wouldn't be talking about it if I didn't think it was at least worth your time. Give it a listen and let me know what you think.
