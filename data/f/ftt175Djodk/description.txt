You'll definitely be disappointed in the new Knife album if you go into it expecting to hear what we've come to expect from the Swedish electropop duo. This thing is unreasonably difficult, and never really illustrates as to why. And the few musical moments at the end of the album might sound like sweet relief, but they're only decent in comparison to the 40 plus minutes of unrewarding crap you have to sift through in order to get to them. This album is a childish attempt at avant composition that only exposes the Knife and their collaborators as specs on a map compared to the big names like Zorn, Stockhausen, and Cage. It's just commissioned art project pap, passing itself off as some kind of deep, conceptual piece of music reflecting the work and life of Charles Darwin. The story could be different if I was actually watching the stage show of this performance piece, but as a standalone album, Tomorrow, In a Year just doesn't work.

But this is just my harsh, unforgiving opinion. What did you think of the album? Like it? Hate it? Why?
