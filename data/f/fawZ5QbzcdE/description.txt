The first track to drop from Wire's upcoming LP, Red Barked Tree, has me less than excited for the album. The track lasts far longer than some of the shortest on their ground-breaking debut, but left me desperately hanging. 

The narrated vocals and noise give me some solace, because it's clear the band is still interested in experimenting; but the looped, generic riffs and bland mix say otherwise. 

What did you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Why? What do you think this upcoming Wire album will hold?

3/10
