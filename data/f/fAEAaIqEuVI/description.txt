New Madvillain single: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=355

These are two new tracks from Arcade Fire's upcoming LP, The Suburbs. "Month of May" has a pulsating, distorted drive behind it; and "The Surburbs" is a whimsical piece of piano pop. Both tracks have their strengths: great production, decent lyrics, top-notch performance. However, they're both lacking something a bit distinct.

What do you think of these tracks? Are they fiery and original, or are they Plain Jane McClain at the end of Smith Lane? Do you like these songs? Do you hate them? Why?
