Though Jesus Piece is easily the most focused album the Game has released in years, it lacks the follow-through to truly develop the concept implied by the cover art, sketches, and song titles. There's some pretty good production on here, though.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
