On his third full-length album, Swedish singer-songwriter Jens Lekman returns with a more simplistic approach, toning down the extremely colorful instrumentation that coated his last LP. Thankfully, the man's charm and wit is all this album needs to stay afloat.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
