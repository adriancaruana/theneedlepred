On their latest album CunninLyngusits bring some seriously cinematic production. All of the atmospheric textures make the perfect setting for lyrical themes dealing with dreams. 

Of course, "dreaming" isn't limited to what you see in your sleep. This LP delves into fantasies of all shapes and sizes: sexual, violent, ambitious. 

As interesting as it is to see Cunnin' take on this topic, I do have to admit that this type of rap music is not for the cynical. I personally don't perceive it to be cheesy, but I could see it reading that way with some people.

Still, the beats alone make it worth a visit, at the very least.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?
