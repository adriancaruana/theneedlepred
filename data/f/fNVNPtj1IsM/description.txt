Abe Vigoda's new album, Crush, is the band's boldest move toward pop yet. However, it's not appealing to me like I  hoped it would. Vigoda's mixture of slightly experimental instrumentation, new wave synths, and crooning vocals is definitely well-intentioned, but it leaves many songs feeling somewhat bland for me. 

But please take this with a grain of salt, because this band never did too much for me in the first place. I was never in love with their stuff, but I found Skeleton and Reviver to be much more interesting than this. Hardcore fans will most likely be used to the ever-evolving sound Vigoda has been working with over the course of four albums. 

I don't want to give the impression that this LP is completely boring or a dingy lack of effort. In fact, the production of Crush proves this release is an intensely labored effort. This time around, you can just chalk the score up to this not being my mug of joe.

What did you think of this album? Fav track? Least fav track? What did you think of the sound? The vocals? Will Abe Vigoda change again on their next release, do you think?
