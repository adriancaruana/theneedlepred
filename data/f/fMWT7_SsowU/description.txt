R.A. The Rugged Man returns with his first album in almost ten years. While he may be rapping faster than ever--and is incredibly vile at points--some of the production on this LP sounds incredibly dated and obvious.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
