On this new collaborative effort from Tim Hecker and Daniel Lopatin, the two artists combine their respective approaches to ambient and experimental music in a way even the most casual fans can predict. That's not a bad thing, though. Where this album falls short is in writing and execution, because a lot of these seemingly improvised pieces lack the direction and presence of the solo material each of these guys have released.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
