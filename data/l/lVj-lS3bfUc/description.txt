Considering this album was coming from a world created by James Mercer and Brian Burton--a.k.a. Danger Mouse--I was expecting a little more from it. Instead of producing a mesh of Burton's studio creativity and Mercer's passionate songwriting, both of these guys use this album to take a backseat. Nothing on this LP burns brightly, takes charge, or attempts to thrill. All in all, it's a pleasant listen, which isn't inherently bad, but Broken Bells only makes for a breezy listen that isn't very engaging. Though the production is clean, and the melodies are agreeable, but I'd be lying to myself if I said this thing stands out.

Have you heard the album? If so, what did you think of it? Love it? Hate it? Is it more exciting than I think? Do I just not "get it"? Do you "get it"? Does any one really "get" anything?
