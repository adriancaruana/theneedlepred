Titus Andronicus have just put on a phenomenally brave and ambitious sophomore album, The Monitor. The tracks on this LP revolve around the American Civil War, and there's not a portion of this album that theme doesn't touch. There's a lot of righteous punk bravado going on throughout this LP, which makes it attention grabbing, but will that attention maintain over the duration of these heavy song lengths. Many of the tracks number from 7-8 mins, and the longest of the bunch is 14. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it will take numerous listens to wrap your head around this rock 'n' roll giant.

Have you heard this album or any of the tracks from it? If so, what do you think of it? Love it? Hate it? Why?
