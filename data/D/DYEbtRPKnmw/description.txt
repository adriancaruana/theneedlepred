Craft Spells' debut LP is a mutated mixtape of the best sounds new wave had to offer. It's a kind of shy LP, but the tunes will definitely stick with anyone willing to lean in and give a close listen.

What do you think of this album? Do you love this album? Do you hate it? Have you even heard it? Would you like to? You should, because it's pretty freakin' enjoyable. What do you think I should review next on this here YouTube channel?
