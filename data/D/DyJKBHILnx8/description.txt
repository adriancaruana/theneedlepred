On this debut Atoms For Peace LP, Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke uses this new band of his to continue honing the electronic style he's been toying with since 2006's The Eraser. Stylistically, it's almost a sequel to Radiohead's The King of Limbs, and this just happens to be one of those moments where the sequel is better.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
