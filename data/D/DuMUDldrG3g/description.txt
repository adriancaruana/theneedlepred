The National's latest is loaded with lush production and somber vocals, but the album may be a little too melancholy for its own good. The sadness here isn't dark or wild. If anything, it's a shade of faded gray. Imagine that going on for almost 50 minutes, and it gets a little meh. But if that emotion is where you wanna be, make sure you hit this album up. Though I didn't like every track on here, there is a group of real winners. "Anyone's Ghost," "Sorrow," and "Conversation 16" are beautifully crafted, and give a lot of attention to detail. I'm a little mixed on this, but how do you feel about this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why?

6/10
