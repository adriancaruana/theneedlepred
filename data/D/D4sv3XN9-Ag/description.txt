Though Bring Me The Horizon comes off as being more ambitious than your average metalcore act out there today, too many of their songs are still bogged down in average riffing and melodramatic lyrics that are really too vague for the listener to draw any specific emotional connections.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
