Detroit rapper Danny Brown's latest album functions in extremes. They're not really the angry, voluminous extremes the latest Death Grips album functions on. They're more like extremes of excess. Of course, what Danny is being excessive with is drugs, sex, misogyny, and basically anything else that one can have too much of.

Though it's nothing new to hear someone rapping about this stuff, Danny takes it from a darker angle. The drugs and sex on this album don't really feel all that flashy or commendable. Instead, it's shocking enough to make a listener wanna go Mormon.

The flows are hard, the beats are pretty experimental, and I'm totally down with this guy's outlandish lyricism. Loving it.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
