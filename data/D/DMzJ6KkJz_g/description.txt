My take on the Lupe / Pete Rock tiff:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ZPYD3rYJc

Though Lupe Fiasco is as sharp as ever when it comes to social commentary, production continues to be a problem for him on Food & Liquor 2: The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
