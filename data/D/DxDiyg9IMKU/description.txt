Harlem's latest album is sixteen tracks of good-time garage rock. Sloppy production, personality, and great hooks are on a few things this album has going for it. Though this LP didn't blow my mind, it's thoroughly enjoyable, and highly energetic. Woot woot!

What do you think of this LP? Awesome or not so awesome? Where does this band st and in the "greater scheme" of garage rock? How would you score this album?

7/10
