Once again, a new Arctic Monkeys album is lost on me. While some may find the band's easygoing rock instrumentation and singer-songwriter Alex Turner's supposedly clever and humorous lyricism to be entertaining, AM is just another move closer toward making the most cold, calculated, and tame rock music imaginable.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
