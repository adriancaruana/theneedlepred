With subtle influences from black and death metal, Lycus has pulled together a heavy and incredibly melodic doom metal album that will probably get you whipping out your air guitar at least a few times during its 40-minute run-time.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
