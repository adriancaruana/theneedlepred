Fever Ray's cover of Peter Gabriel's Mercy Street is certainly a flattering act, but I honestly enjoy the original and Fever's earlier work much better. The production feels a little dull, and the persistent vocal effects ruin the song a bit for me in this instance. It's not offensively bad, but I don't see myself enjoying it past the first couple listens.

But still: Fever Ray, thanks for turning me on to this track. You're the best.

5/10
