This new single from Foals upcoming album, Total Life Forever, is beautifully layered, mixed, and written. I can't say it redefines or expands the world of indie rock, but it is one of the most well-groomed pieces of music I've heard in that style.The sounds on this thing are almost panoramic, and the performance is great. I love the builds and falls throughout the track, fading one section of the song into another. Very dynamic, very catchy, and can't talk all that much crap about it. Good song, guys.
