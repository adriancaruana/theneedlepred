Billy Woods and Elucid team up on Race Music to make one of the most dense hip hop albums to come out this year. With seventeen tracks laced with this duo's esoteric lyricism, this one's gonna require quite a few replays for maximum enjoyment and comprehension. A few shaky choruses on tracks like "Hand Over Fist" and "Renaissance Garments," but still a rap album worth reading into!

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
