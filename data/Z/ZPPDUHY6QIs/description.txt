The first track from Brian Eno's upcoming album is a serious teaser. It hints toward dense mixes loaded with amazing sounds, but doesn't exactly deliver for too long before it cuts and runs. It's a build up to something that could end up being really amazing.

How do you feel about this track? Does it feel like a teaser to you? Are you lovin' it? Hatin' it? Why? What do you expect of this forthcoming Eno album?
