Most tribute albums don't go over that well, and I can't make a promise that you'll think Xiu Xiu's Nina is an exception. However, from where I'm standing, this collection of recordings is incredibly twisted, bizarre, beautiful, and moving.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
