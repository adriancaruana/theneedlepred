The latest single from Oakland's Bare Wire's is a fast little garage pop number with some slight wear and tear. The production is kinda muddy, keeping a lot of the love-sick lyrics from translating in the mix. The guitar riffs and solos still pack a lot of emotion, though. The hook is catchy as hell, too. It's too short and simple to hate, but also lacking enough distinct sounds to really, really love. I think I'm simply just crushing on this band.
