Producer Lee Bannon fully transitions into a different sound on this new record, distancing himself from the hip hop beats he's most known for. While he sounds completely at home making jungle and breakbeat, I was hoping he'd redecorate a bit more.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
