Though the latest effort from Pig Destroyer is undeniably an all-out riff fest, I'm not feeling the same thrilling level of intensity I typically enjoy from this genre in general.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

FAV TRACKS: THE UNDERGROUND MAN, MACHIAVELLIAN, WHITE LADY, KAMIKAZE HEART, TOTALED, DIRTY KNIFE, BURNING PALM 

(Note: Burning Palm is one of the few tracks with a breakdown at the end of it that I think is spectacular, which is mostly due to Jarvis' tight double bass work on that part of the track. NICEEEEE!)

LEAST FAV TRACK: BALTIMORE STRANGLER

PIG DESTROYER- BOOK BURNER / RELAPSE / 2012 / GRINDCORE, MOSH RIFFS AND MOSH RIFFS AND MOSH RIFFS

6/10

Y'all know this is just my opinion, right?
