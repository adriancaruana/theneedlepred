Delighted People review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCixPRPXCb8

Sufjan's latest LP isn't going to go down in history as one of my favorites, but it's not like it's all that bad either.

The Age of Adz delivers on all the talk of electronics that built up to it, but the sounds Stevens bring to the table aren't that dynamic or interesting--which is surprising considering how vast Enjoy Your Rabbit was.

I like the songs, lyrics, melodies, and orchestrations a lot. The electronic beats and production is really what kills it for me. I have no doubt that Sufjan's avid fans will love to hear him go down this avenue, but I just can't follow him too far down this road without feeling bored.

6/10
