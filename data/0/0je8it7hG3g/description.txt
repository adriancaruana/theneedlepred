/\/\ /\ Y /\ causes as much racket as its predecessors, but the shroud of noise doesn't cover the plain song structures. One of the most disheartening things about this release is the drought of musical influences from around the world. This thing heads deep into experimental electro territory, producing some pretty straightforward moments like "XXXO" and "Tell Me Why."

But aside from dipping her toes into dubstep on several tracks, I fail to see how MIA has really advanced past Kala. Instead of moving forward, it feels like she's stepped to the side, experimenting more in some areas and watering down her eccentricities in others.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Really hate it? Really, really hate it? Why?
