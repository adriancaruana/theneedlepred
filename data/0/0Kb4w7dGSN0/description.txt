With the third full-length LP since their reunion in '05, underground rock icons Dinosaur Jr. is doing what they usually do with the quality fans have come to expect. It's a bit more mellow than 2009's Farm, which has its ups and downs, but still very enjoyable to say the least.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
