The Black Keys have come back with a return to their classic sound on Brothers; concentrating on making their drums and guitar foundation sound better than ever. The band brings in some great variation, too, making sure each track sounds different than the next. They've learned from their past experiences, and are improving upon their style; however, it's kinda difficult for me to say this album overthrows classics like Rubber Factory. I don't think it does, but this LP is still highly enjoyable. Lots of consistency and great production, too. I wish there could have been some more contrast in the songwriting department, though.

What do you think of this album? How would you score it? Do you like this LP or do you hate it? Dig the Black Keys? Is this better than Attack & Release? Worse?
