On his latest EP, the Books member Nick Zammuto deals in the same experimental sounds that made his main band's previous album so great. I will say the singer-songwriter element of the three songs on this release is more prevalent, though.

What do you think of this EP? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
