White Lies' sophomore album is built on the kind of cleanliness and safety post-punk's roots were spitting in the face of. The band completely avoids veering off of the path set before them by bands like Joy Division, Depeche Mode, and Interpol. If there's any alteration to the formula, White Lies does it with a bigger budget and sound. 

Of course, if I found the songs to be catchier, the lack of adventure wouldn't be such a big deal; however, that's not where we're standing.

What do you think about this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?

4/10
