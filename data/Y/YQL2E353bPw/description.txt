On their latest single, N.E.R.D sounds like an odd combo of French electro and Prince, so it's no surprise that Daft Punk actually produced this track.

While the sexy picture Pharrell paints with his vocals can get pretty poetic, he can't help but throw a wrench in the works by mindlessly repeating "touch it, girl" or rattling off the various values of American currency.

It's not the worst song in the world, for sure, but it's nowhere near blowing my mind.

What did you think of this track? How do you feel about the new N.E.R.D. album? What should I review next?

5/10
