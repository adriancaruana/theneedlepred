White Hinterland's third album is the most instrumentally complex thing I've heard this project deliver thus far. Not only that but mastermind Casey Dienel's voice is sounding better than ever between all of these power piano ballads and dense, soulful art pop tunes.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
