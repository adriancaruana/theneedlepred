This new, original track from Health's upcoming Disco2 has me looking forward for the remix album a lot. There's also word artists such as Javelin, Crystal Castles, and Tobacco will be remixing songs from Health's previous album, Get Color. 

On this song, Health is sticking to their guns, but they're pointing them in a dancier, more accessible direction. I love the building sensation the sounds give, along with just about everything else "USA Boys" has to offer. 

What do you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Why?

8/10
