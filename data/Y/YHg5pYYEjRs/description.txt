Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeroes third full-length album feels even rougher than last year's Here. However, the band is going in a slightly more retro direction, embracing the sonic palate of 60s psychedelic pop.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
