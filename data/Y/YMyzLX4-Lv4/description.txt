On their latest album, Emeralds take a slightly different approach than they did on 2009's What Happened. There's a lot less distortion, noise, and lengthy explorative tracks on this new LP. The band chooses to keep things short and sweet, sticking to tracks that mostly range from three to four minutes. But a lot happens within these time constraints: sharp guitar solos, bubbling synth arpeggios, and warm electronic chords gently pulsate in an ambient fashion. Very pretty colors and extremely promising instrumentation. But to go back to the song lengths: the shorter amounts of time really do choke off how much the band and the listener are able to explore a given musical idea. This isn't pop, and there's no reason for some of these tracks to be this abrupt. Venture into the unknown a little. 

What did you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why?

6/10
