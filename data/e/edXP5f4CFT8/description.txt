On First Four EPs, Off! gives punk music a well-needed wake up call. The riffs, drums, and lyrics all call back to that hardcore heyday when Black Flag was tearing it up. All 16 of these tracks don't even flirt with being two minutes long, and the rage in Keith Morris' voice is something to behold.

It's consistent, to the point, and forceful. What more could you want? Well, besides more.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?
