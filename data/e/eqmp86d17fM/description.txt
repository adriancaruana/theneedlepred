Apologies to you guys, because the NPR stream is no longer up, but you can give a listen to the opening track, which was posted by Thou's label at this link: http://bit.ly/9uHMKu

MackasaurFM's review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS6399FO-mc

On Thou's third album, the band brings their sludge sound to a new extreme, and brings some extra instrumentation into the fold, too. Though there are some nice spots of violin, acoustic guitar, and even horns, blaring guitar chugs are  still what makes this album what it is. I would have preferred more variation, but the slow and intense pace of Summit is something to behold. Tun this thing up and destroy a city.

If you've heard it, what did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?

7/10
