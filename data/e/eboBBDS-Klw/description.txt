On his sophomore release, B.o.B climbs further up the mainstream ladder by continuing to blend hip hop with some of the poppiest sounds imaginable. While a few singles in this style aren't bad, B.o.B overdoes it a bit by making nearly every track shoot for some kind of pre-chewed, radio-friendly sound. The end result is an album that doesn't feel all that personal or engaging. Rather, it's pretty one-size-fits all.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
