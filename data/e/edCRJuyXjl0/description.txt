Sharon Van Etten's Epic is a real shot of ambition from the New York singer-songwriter. Some of these tracks are the catchiest Sharon has penned thus far in her short career. She hasn't forgot to venture into the unknown, though; bringing a few accordion drones and skeletal moments in the folk to keep what she does best fresh in her mind.

It's a little short of breath, but this release does have a decent run with seven tracks. It's definitely got me excited to hear what she does in the future. 

What did you think of this release? Love it? Hate it? Why? What album album album should I review next?

7/10
