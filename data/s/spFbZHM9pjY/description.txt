Nosaj Thing's sophomore album still has the soft, quaint sounds fans have enjoyed previously from California producer Jason Chung, but with a serious decline in the hip hop vibes that radiated so boldly off of 2009's Drift.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
