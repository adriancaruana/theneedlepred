Unfortunately, the latest Yeah Yeah Yeahs album is one of those instances when the album's lead single seems to be the best track, dwarfing nearly every other song on the album with ambition, glitz, and great songwriting. The rest of the album is a bit spotty, in my opinion.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
