This new track from R.E.M. isn't amazing me, but it does have me looking forward to a new album from these guys. Maybe the track will be a little more captivating in the midst of its counterparts. I do like the eerie and jangly sounds coming out if this thing, but it loses its experimental side once the chorus starts building.

Some would take that as a good thing, but it just kinda ruins the mood--for me, anyway. 

What do you think of this song? Love it? Hate it? Excited for this upcoming album? Do you follow R.E.M. still? Are they still relevant? Are yoU losing your religion? Do you expect big things for this album? Will the band branch out and reach new listeners, or will this album be "for the fans"?

6/10
