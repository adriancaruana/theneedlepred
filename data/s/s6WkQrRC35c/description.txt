When it comes to loud, visceral trap rap, there are plenty of songs worth recommending on this new Migos mixtape. The problem is it's so packed with filler that finding the cartoony, eccentric, and occasionally hilarious gems on this thing can be a bit of a chore. 

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
