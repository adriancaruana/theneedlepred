On his second full-length album as How To Dress Well, singer and producer Tom Krell shows some stellar improvements in his production techniques, delivering a set of much clearer songs that sound almost heavenly. If you're down for some adventurous, R&B-influenced dream pop, try it out.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

LEAST FAV TRACK: SAY MY NAME OR SAY WHATEVER (Yes, I did make a mistake, and accidentally omitted the second "say" when mentioning this track in the review. My apologies. I messed up. I'm a flawed, opinionated human being. Douse me in kerosene and light me ablaze.
