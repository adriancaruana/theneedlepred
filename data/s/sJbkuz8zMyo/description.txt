Candy Claws bring their fuzzy, lo-fi sound together with some creatively arranged psych pop instrumentation for a dream pop album that's musically and sonically dense. It's like biting into a juicy piece of pineapple the size of a tractor-trailer.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
