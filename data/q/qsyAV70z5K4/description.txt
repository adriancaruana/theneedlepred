The World Is A Beautiful Place And I Am No Longer Afraid To Die has pulled together an undeniably solid indie rock album on this debut LP of theirs. If you like your vocals incredibly emotional--and slightly wimpy--this should appeal!

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
