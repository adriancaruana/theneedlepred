Women interview: http://bit.ly/9jlpu2

Women's new album isn't enjoyable for the same reasons most music is. There isn't an abundance of hooks or sweet melodies here. Instead, Public Strain is filled with a bleak, isolating tension. It's something that I've been looking for--subconsciously, maybe--in a 2010 record.

How haunting and alone this album feels is what makes it stand out so much. But I don't want to give the impression that this LP is nothing but a mopey, self-loathing piece of trash. It's far from it. It's more like the sound of one man's insanity after hearing nothing but silence for an entire year. A weird description, I know, but it's how I feel about this record.

How do you feel about this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why?
