Listen: http://soundcloud.com/eone-music/wu-block-drivin-round

Members of Wu-Tang Clan and D-Block--mostly Ghostface Killah and Sheek Louch--get together for a mostly enjoyable collection of hardcore hip hop songs loaded with gritty tales told with charismatic flows.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
