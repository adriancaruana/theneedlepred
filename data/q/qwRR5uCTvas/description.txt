2. New Ganglians track: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=4439

On their latest album, Explosions In the Sky gives the appearance of evolution with some added instrumentation: acoustic guitar, strings, hums, looped percussion, and other miscellaneous noises. However, the band hasn't really altered their playing style or sonic qualities that much. The mood has changed a little, but this is still the same band that brought All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone.

For some, that could be a great thing. Personally, it's left me really underwhelmed. Not only did I assume--a bad thing on my part, I admit--there would be some great change coming in the four years between this release and their last, but I'm not really a fan of many of the new sounds this record brings to the table. I'm enjoying some spots in the gargantuan post-rock anthems, but I'm struggling with hear an entire track without becoming bored or disengaged.

I'll just have to look forward to what these guys do in the future.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

5/10
