Sweden's Holograms aren't the most original band on the block, but their take on post-punk is enjoyably passionate, catchy, and dark.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

FAV TRACKS: MONOLITH, ORPHEO, MEMORIES OF SWEAT, ABC CITY, STRESS, ASTRAY

LEAST FAV TRACK: I'm gonna say CHASING MY MIND, but it's not like I disliked it or anything. A decent track, but I feel the others on here are more impressive.

HOLOGRAMS- SELF-TITLED / 2012 / CAPTURED TRACKS / POST-PUNK, ART PUNK, DEPRESSIVE SWEDISH PUNK, UNHAPPINESS

8/10 http://www.theneedledrop.com/loved-list/2012

Y'all know this is just my opinion, right?
