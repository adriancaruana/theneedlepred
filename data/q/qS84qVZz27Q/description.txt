This latest number from the Canadian rock band Black Mountain conjures the same old world rock ethics many of their songs do, but there's something almost too modern and commercial about the verse on this track to get me loving it.

I can't help but think of bands like Saliva when I hear that chugging guitar on the opening of this one, sadly. I don't want to feel that way--especially since I love the band's previous work so much.

I might grow on me at time, but even multiple listens to this one wasn't making it warm up to me. I'm sure the new album will be loaded with different rock styles on it, though. Still looking forward to that thing.

What do you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Do the guitars bug you as much as they bug me? Am I just crazy and don't know what I'm talking about? Let me know.
