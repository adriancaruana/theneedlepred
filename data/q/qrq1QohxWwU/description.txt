jj's new mixtape is harmless in theory, but don't let the soft, pink cover fool you. This thing is a relentless gauntlet of auto-tuned madness.

Though I like a lot of the tunes jj samples on this thing, it's not like the lifted music is manipulated or changed all that much. It sounds like reverb was all that was really added in the production process. Oh, and I forgot: A lot of the beats are constantly fading up and down in the volume department, which is kinda confusing. Actually, this whole record is a little bewildering to me. 

Thank you, Internet.
