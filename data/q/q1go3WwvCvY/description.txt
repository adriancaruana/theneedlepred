On their sophomore LP, Smith westerns have cleaned up their act with better production, songs, and guitar licks. The hooks here are catchy as hell, and the melodies infectiously upbeat. It's nice to hear a band that can build songs both simple and complex with the same amount of energy.

The album does hold some issues in the vocal department, though. The band obviously tries to make up for it by drowning out a lot of the singing by playing louder and mixing the vocals lower. I'm not exactly sure how the problem can be rectified, but it's definitely taking away from the impact on a good deal of these songs.

What did you think of this album? Did you love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, y'all?
