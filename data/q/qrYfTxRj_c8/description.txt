This is the first single from Deftones' upcoming album, Diamond Eyes. The LP is due in May, and I certainly hope this song isn't a sign of what's to come. Though this track isn't outright awful, it's a big step in a less experimental direction--even when you compare it to previous singles such as Minerva. The toss back and forth between the extremely plain riff and the wall-of-sound chorus wasn't anything to get up in arms about, to be frank; but it's still nice to see this band's return to music after 2006's Saturday Night Wrist.

And much like that album, I'm sure Diamond Eyes' other tracks will offer much more engaging, thought-provoking ideas than this single.

What did you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Why?

4/10
