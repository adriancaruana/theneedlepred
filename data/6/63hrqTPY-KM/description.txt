To be frank, Lotus Plaza frontman Lockett Pundt sounds like he's put together an assembly of Deerhunter tracks under the Lotus Plaza name on this album. While this doesn't seem like a bad thing for hardcore fans, it left me a little underwhelmed--mostly because Lotus Plaza presents a noticeable difference in effort, production, and detail.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
