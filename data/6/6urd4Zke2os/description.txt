2. New Owen Pallett EP: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=2226

Ghostface's new album is a return to form for the smooth and cocky Wu-Tang member. He's backed off the r&b and auto-tune from his previous LP and has returned to straight rhymes and hard beats. 

Though the album isn't reinventing rap or adding something new to the art, it's great to have a strong reminder of what the foundation is. No flowers, drama, or fuss here. This gets down to business.

What do you think of this album? Like it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
