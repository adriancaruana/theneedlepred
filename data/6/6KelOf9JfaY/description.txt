Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2013/02/kvelertak-bruane-brenn/

Kvelertak delivers once again with high energy, solid production, anthemic melodies, catchy choruses, and a tastefully executed blend of influences: rock 'n' roll, black metal, hardcore punk, and heavy metal.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
