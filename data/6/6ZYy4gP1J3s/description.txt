Yuck's latest album is a fun embrace of the sound on classic albums from Dinosaur Jr., Yo La Tengo, Elliott Smith, and many more artists and bands considered "90s."

While this album is an alright place to visit, it's hard to exactly describe where you are. That's because Yuck doesn't have anything going for them that you could draw specifically to them.

Though I'm not against "borrowing," or showing off your influences, I can't say this album is enticing me. It's just kind of making me want to listen to the classics is all.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?

5/10
