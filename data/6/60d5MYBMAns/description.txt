On Mount Eerie's latest effort, Phil Elverum managest to transform is usual sounds and emotions into a repetitive, drone-y, and sometimes ambient musical experience. Mostly, it's beautiful, but a few moments felt a bit overlong to me. Plus, despite being well over 40 minutes, I didn't come away from this album feeling completely satisfied with the songs and material I was dealt. Still, it's a very solid album. Phil keeps the sounds of Mount Eerie potent, strange, and emotionally affecting while changing things up enough to keep his musical trajectory interesting for longtime fans.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
