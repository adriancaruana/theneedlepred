"Airbrushed" will be the first of Anamanaguchi's 2010 summer singles to get a physical release this March. This ultra-melodic rock anthem is an awesome overload that has to power to make both eyes and smiles to wide.

There's no doubt that these guys are smashing any preconceived notions about the legitimacy of 8-bit music.

What do you think of this track? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review in the future?
