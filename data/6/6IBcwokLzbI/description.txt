Warpaint's debut LP is an album of deeply hypnotic rock songs that slowly unfold with one phrase evolving into the next. It's an album that takes time to expose itself. It took me a couple of listens to really let the atmosphere of the LP surround me and hypnotize me. 

Sadly, the Fool doesn't end with the strength it starts. The band seems to drift away from the formula that made earlier tracks so great with an acoustic number, some prominent electronics, and heavy-handed piano chords. 

I still found the album to be enjoyable, though. It's just not making my eyes roll back into my head. There's clearly a lot of talent in this band, and I'm extremely happy to hear a new band with a female lineup that isn't falling into the same trend of Shangri-La worship.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?

6/10
