On "You and I" Washed Out brings on the lead singer of NY's Chairlift to add some extra emotion and color. This track stand at 5 minutes, but it feels like I could wrap myself in this thing for an eternity. I don't know whether to dance or sleep while listening to this thing. I love the beats, reverb, synths--everything, basically. No complaints, my Needle Drops, no complaints.
