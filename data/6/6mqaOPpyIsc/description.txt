On the Horrors third LP, the primary colors that combined to created the band's eccentric brand of post-punk start to fade a little bit; however, I think the move is sort of intentional.

Rather than sticking to their guns, the band is moving in a decidedly psychedelic and atmospheric direction with many tracks on Skying. And while their aren't any terrible tracks to be heard on this release, some of the results are underwhelming, admittedly.

Still, if you've been a fan of the band up until this point, there's no reason not to visit this release, because there are definitely some leaner and brighter songs to be heard among these ten tracks.

7/10

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
