On his first full-length debut, Big Boi calls on nearly everyone in the biz to come on his record to rap, sing, and produce. Though it's awesome to see such a star-studded list of guests, it's lead this album into some extremely unbearable inconsistency. It seems some tracks are content to be overly sappy or obnoxious just because there's a great guest in the mix. 

There are some real barn-burners on this LP, but way too many low points to start singing this record's praises in the streets. Feeling kinda "meh" on this, but what do you think of this record? Love it? Hate it? Why?

6/10
