On Arckanum's fith studio album, titled ÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞ, this one-man band breathes some new life into the classic sounds of BM. Without jumping into the realm of overproduction, this album has some really quality sounds. It's not as alienating as some lo-fi BM recordings may be, and something a range of metal fans could appreciate. There's quite a bit of variation among these tracks, too; it's just enough to make the 50 minutes they span a worthwhile listen. Definitely looking forward to what Arckanum does in the future.
