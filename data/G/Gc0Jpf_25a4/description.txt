Tim Hecker's latest album is a barren wasteland of forgotten sounds. It's music you can truly wander through. 

Some tracks do feel a little short of breath, sadly, but there are many more standouts here than there are duds.

It's another strong piece of material in the Hecker canon. It may be difficult to separate this from his other work--simply because he shifts his sound very subtly from album to album--but it should be expected than LP of this nature would take a little extra attention when it comes to understanding it.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
