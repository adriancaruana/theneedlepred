This review is obviously much earlier than the April 13th release date of this album, but Congratulations is currently all over the net--and even streaming at NPR Music at the time of this video's upload. MGMT's Congratulations makes me want to say this to the band: Congratulations. It's a neo-psych rock drama, bursting with cinematic tracks. A real solid beginning-to-end listen. Some songs pale in comparison to others, but Congratulations still avoids falling prey to high highs and low lows. This music is a modern day take on the rock guys like Bowie, The Beatles, and Arthur Brown were playing with back in the day, and it even takes the time to pick up some new wave and post-punk influences, too. MGMT is clearly well-versed in the language of rock, and this album is a result of the fluency.
