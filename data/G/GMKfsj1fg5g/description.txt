If you enjoyed Girl Talk's last album, Feed the Animals, then All Day should be right up your alley, too. Greg serves up another continuous mashup epic that spans an entire hour.

There's not much to note in terms of changes. The only issue I could see coming up in the future is that the sound might get hold; however, that's now what it looks like from where I'm standing.  

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?

FAV TRACKS: Isn't the whole album one long track, really?
