How To Dress Well is easily one of the eeriest lo-fi projects to come out this year. Its influences range from ambient electronica to modern R&B. 

The album has its impressive moments, but most of them are ruined by the shoddy sound quality. All the vocal peaking and overmodulation could be completely intentional. Either way, it doesn't change the end product.

It's like reading a great story loaded with bad grammar. The intentions are great, but a lot of beauty gets lost in translation on this LP. But that's just my opinion.

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why?
