This is Devo's first album in 20 years, and the band still has the same rigid, geeky rock energy that made their first albums so unique. At times, this band's shtick can wear thin with me, but the songs I do love on this LP are real heavy hitters. There were a few tracks I disliked, but it's still amazing to hear Devo back in the saddle.
