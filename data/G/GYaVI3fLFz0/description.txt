Rapper Danny Brown returns with Old. It's an album that mirrors the Detroit native's constant cycle of drug-fueled partying and remorse that was introduced on 2011's XXX. The major difference this time around being heavier instrumentals and Danny's split personalities feeling even more at odds.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
