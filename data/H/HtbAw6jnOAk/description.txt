Two tracks from the upcoming Crystal Castles album, which is due on June 7th. I'm not feeling the same excitement I did from the bands previous LP, or their early demos. These tracks have some interesting production, but there's some kind of excitement that's just lacking here. Part of it is due to what I say in the vid, but I can't help but think there's something else, too.

But what do you think of the songs? Love 'em? Hate 'em? Why? What do you expect of the forthcoming album?
