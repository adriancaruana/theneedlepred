On Kreator's 13th studio album, the band starts employing more melody, harmony, and righteous chord progressions with mixed results.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, too?

FAV TRACKS: PHANTOM ANTICHRIST, DEATH TO THE WORLD, THE FEW, THE PROUD, THE BROKEN

LEAST FAV TRACK: FROM FLOOD INTO FIRE

Y'all know this is just my opinion, right?
