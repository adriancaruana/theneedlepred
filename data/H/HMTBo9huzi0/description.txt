Dumbo Gets Mad's debut album is a pretty hefty piece of psychedelic rock and pop. Rarely does anything about this LP come off as "normal." We're basically talking about an album full of odd synths, chipmunked vocals, bubble samples, and lyrics about prawns.

So it's hard to promote this simply as a "rock album," because experimentation and effects play such a heavy role in shaping the music here. Think of it as FlyLo's Cosmogramma from a psych rock perspective.

Despite all the indulgence, the sounds here are great. This thing has a huge, warm sound that could have only come from an analog recording. The music an come off a little too hectic or cacophonous at times, but it wouldn't be much an adventure if the jungle wasn't dense with plants.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
