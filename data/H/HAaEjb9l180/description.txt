Natural Child's self-titled 7'' is a fierce piece of garage punk. These guys party hard on their songs. So hard, I had a hang over just from listening to this thing on repeat.

If you're in the market for something rough, fun, and wild, lend your ears.

What do you think of this EP? Love it? Hate it? Why?

8/10
