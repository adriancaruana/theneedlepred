It might seem impossible, but this album is actually somewhat solid. I can't say it's going to make history in Weezer's discography--maybe for it's cover--but it's certainly a bright spot considering its predecessors were Raditude and Red. 

Rivers' songwriting is still strong, and the band compliments them with their usual shtick. But here, they're at least sounding a little more natural than they have been these past few years.

Of course, it's never gonna be like the old days again, but this is LP won't be one of my reasons to complain.

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why? How would you score it? High? Low?
