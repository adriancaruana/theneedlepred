My review of the band's previous EP: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xuji7NIhP1g

On the Budos Band's third album is the first time I feel really lost on the band. I'm not sure what to make of the darker sound that pervades this album, and I'm especially confused about all of the repetition. The band clearly doesn't want to repeat their past efforts, but they've made a bad switch by exchanging their sense of exploration for a moodier direction. Though I still have faith in the band as a musical force, this new album just isn't winning me over. I really wanted it to, too. 

What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why?
