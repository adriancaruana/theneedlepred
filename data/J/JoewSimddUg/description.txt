On this debut full-length Eprom explores some interesting musical ideas, bringing together the sounds of glitch hop, future garage, dubstep, and more. Frankly, there's not much the guy doesn't try out between these three tracks. But what kinda pulls them all together is that he maintains a certain simple subtlety on much of these tracks.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
