On St. VIncent's latest album, singer-songwriter Annie Clark comes together with some pretty bold and experimental flavors.
I wouldn't be surprised if fans found this to be a stranger record than 2009's Actor.

But while many moments on Strange Mercy are, uh, strange, I found this record incredibly easy to get into.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, too?
