AFI's Burials is the latest in a long string of uninteresting records from this California band. While I'm not a big fan of the group's early stuff, at least LPs like Sing The Sorrow had a modicum of aggression or excitement. The radio-friendly records the band has been dropping as of late have really been doing nothing for me, and Burials is possibly the least entertaining of all of them.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
