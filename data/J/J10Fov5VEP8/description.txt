Comet Gain doesn't sound too unlike your average indie rock group, but they manage to lace their songs with some extremely memorable hooks and passionate vocals. Even though it's nothing new, it's difficult for me to deny.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
