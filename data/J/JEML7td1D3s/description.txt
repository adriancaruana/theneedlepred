Wormrot's brand of grindcore will probably strike most people as being old school. Their dedication to thrash metal riffs and a natural-sounding production style calls back to the genre's salad days in the 80s.

But not everything here is from the past. The band's intensity and speedy drums and guitar definitely feel 2011.

To me, this album is a reminder that musical movements can miss great things if everyone is in a rush to follow a trend or new extreme. Going back and putting a modern twist on an old sound can have great results.

In short, THIS IS BR00TAL! OMG!!!!!

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Hate gindcore in general? What should I review next?
