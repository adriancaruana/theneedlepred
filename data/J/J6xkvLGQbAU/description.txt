Listen to some of this album: http://theneedledrop.com/2012/06/guardian-alien-see-the-world/

New York's Guardian Alien shoots for the stars on this new album, and delivers a chaotic, psychedelic 37-minute song.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
