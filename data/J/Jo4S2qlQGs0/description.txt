Kanye's fifth studio album is easily his most ambitious effort yet. The production is extremely stunning. To be honest, this album sounds like a really huge undertaking with all of it's extra instrumentation, studio tricks, and samples.

Kanye has stepped up his rhyme game, too. It's also comforting to hear his guest MCs are rapping on his level. 

My one problem is I think someone would need to have some kind of interest in Kanye West as a person, or persona, to truly fall in love with this album. I, unfortunately, don't really care about the minor details of the guy's social life. He's got a lot of talent, but his relationships and various character flaws don't really pique my interest for the entire album. There are points where I can't help but cheer him on when he tells his personal tale of success, but I could take or leave the moments of contrived social drama. 

There's a lot to love about this thing. I'm just not won over on it personality-wise.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next?
