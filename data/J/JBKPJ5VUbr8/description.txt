While it's not as psychedelic as more acclaimed Spiritualized albums, Sweet Heart Sweet Light delivers a solid set of songs that return to the band's best old school ideas, and refines the more straightforward tracks that have been featured on recent releases.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
