Let's get a couple things straight: Kevin Barnes is a great songwriter and of Montreal is one of the most interesting bands out there today. However, the jumbled, obnoxious, bizarre sounds on this album are turning me off without question. 

False Priest takes it down a notch with the electronics, but that hasn't stopped the music from coming off eccentric. Barnes' vocal delivery is more pronounced than ever, layering one wacky falsetto over another. 

There were a lot of highs and lows for me on this album, which will make for great conversation among fans. This band still has my admiration, but that doesn't mean I'm going to follow them everywhere they go.

What did you think of this album? Awesome? Not so awesome? What would you score it? What did you think of the band's last LP? Does anyone listen to Cherry Peel anymore?

5/10
