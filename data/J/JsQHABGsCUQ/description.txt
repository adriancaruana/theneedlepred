Darkthrone's latest album, Circle the Wagons, is a ballsy piece metalhead artillery. The guitar sounds are fantastic, and the drums are the perfect compliment to how brash the music is. However, I have to say this is one of those instances where one isolated part of this music is ruining the whole thing for me: the vocals. Whether it's the recording or the mixing, they sound so tinny and out of place. It's almost as if the vocal tracks were meant for a different album.

The music is still undeniably catchy and brutal, but I just wish the vox lived up to that same standard. 

Circle the Wagons is a shot of hardcore adrenaline. I tend of overanalyze things, and this isn't exactly an "anylazation" kind of album. If you're looking for pure guts and a "fuck off" kind of attitude, this is where you wanna be.

Have you heard this album? If so, what do you think of it? Love it? Hate it? Why?

5/10
