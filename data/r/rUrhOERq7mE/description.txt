No Age single: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=778

Honestly, this new single has me excited for Weezer's upcoming album. Sure, they're not writing with the heart-wrenching emotion their earliest albums were wrought with, but "Memories" is much less canned than anything that was on Raditude. Plus, the band has mad a surprising shift to Epitaph Records for the release of this album. Also, considering the lyrical content of this track, we could totally be in for something that revisits the old world of Weezer just a little bit. Loved the hook, and the production was pretty good, too.

What did you think of this track? Hmmmmm?

7/10
