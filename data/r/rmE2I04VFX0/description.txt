After ten years of being a band, Kayo Dot releases what might be its gaudiest album. However, I can't help but be enamored with the strong playing, ambitious concept, and impressive mix of influences most of the time.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
