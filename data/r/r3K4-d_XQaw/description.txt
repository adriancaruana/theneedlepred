On this new, collaborative album, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis bring some great pop rap tracks with a conscious edge, but don't quite live up to the epic and ambitious expectations set by stellar singles like "Wings" and "Same Love."

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
