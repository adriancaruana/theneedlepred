Stylistically, I think Tripper is an exciting return to Hella's old, stripped down form. Some fans may see it as a bit of a regression, but that's only half of the truth. The duo throws in some overdubbed guitars and bass, and manages to utilize some of the tricks they've learned working in various side-projects since the release of 2007's There's No 666 In Outer Space. There are moments on here where I actually feel could have made it onto a Zach Hill solo album.

The downside is, though I do think Hella is sounding pretty fierce on this album, the songs are filtered through a pretty weak recording. The guitars and drums sound tinny, flat, and claustrophobic. It's hardly the range of lows and highs I'd want in order to appreciate the intricate, detailed performances laced into this album. 

Despite that unforgettable pothole, I like a good chunk of the tracks on here. I can't say I hated any, but I was left feeling like this was just another Hella record in some spots. However, I wouldn't want to hear anybody make a Hella record but Hella.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

6/10
