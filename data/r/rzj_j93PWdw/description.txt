Yourewrongimright's review: http://bit.ly/9GFLH1

On Black City, Matthew Dear constructs a world of dark, druggy lullabies and gothic disco anthems. Though it hops from style to style, the album maintains an extremely dark feel--even in the face of highly danceable beats. 

It borders on monotony at some points, and Matthew Dear definitely doesn't make a name for himself here as a wordsmith; however, the production and atmosphere on this album are too good to completely deny. I love most of the tracks, and I imagine any fan of electronic music would.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?

7/10
