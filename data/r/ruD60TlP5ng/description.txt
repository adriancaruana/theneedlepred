2. New Holy Ghost! track: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3197

On their latest single, Explosions In the Sky has condensed their usual sound into a 3-minute epic. It might be shocking for newer fans to hear the band put out something shorter, but it's not like they haven't experimented with being straightforward before.

My issue is mostly with the sounds of this track. What is that repeating wine--or wail--in the beginning of the track. Why all the humming? Plus, the guitars aren't exactly sticking with me either. I'm hoping this will sound better in the context of the album.

What do you think of this track? Do you love it? Do you hate it? Do you still think this new EITS album is gonna rule? Will it top their last one? Will it top every post-rock album ever? What is post-rock?
