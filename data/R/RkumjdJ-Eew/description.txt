Small Craft On A Milk Sea is Brian Eno's next step in ambient music production. The soundscapes on this LP are vast and textured. Each song conjures an army of images that march through my head: infinite landscapes, endless skies, slow-motion deaths, and epic battles. 

There's a bit of an issue in terms of cohesion among these songs, though. It seems there might be some kind of theme if you were looking simply at the song titles, but there doesn't seem to be much stringing this album together from a sonic perspective.

However, the quality of these tracks is still high. If you're into exploring sound, then this is the album for you.

What did you think of this? Love it? Hate it? Why? Fav track? What should I review next?
