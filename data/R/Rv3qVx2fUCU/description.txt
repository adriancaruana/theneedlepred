Australian death metal outfit Portal has a sound that impenetrably thick and noisy, and they use it to bombard listeners with an ever-changing series of riffs and dismal melodies. However, when it comes to the composition of these riffs and melodies, the album is pretty run-of-the-mill by death metal standards

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
