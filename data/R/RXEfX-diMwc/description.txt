Future Islands' new album makes me want to watch this outfit like a hawk. With this sound, I feel like the potential to put out something great. There are certainly some really bright moments on this album like "Walking Through That Door" and "Swept Inside," but there are pieces that fall to the wayside in terms of songwriting or production quality.

Even though this release is over thirty minutes, it still comes off feeling like a disjointed EP, not a fully fleshed LP based on a cohesive theme. 

Still, the vocals, keyboards, and drum machines are a killer combo for these guys. I'm sure they could work with other dynamics, but there's definitely some room to grow here.
