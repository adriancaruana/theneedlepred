On Rival Sons' sophomore album, the California quartet makes the classic sounds of hard rock and blues rock kind of exciting again. While these dudes are nowhere near as flashy as some of the bands that influence them, they do pull together some really great sounds on this LP.

Pressure & Time is an album that drowns in its influences a bit, though. There is a modern sound to this record, but it's not exactly like these guys are reinventing the wheel.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? What should I review next, eh?

7/10
