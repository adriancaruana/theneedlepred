Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar doesn't follow the usual tough and hardened stereotypes that come with repping the California city. The guy isn't a wimp, but he's more interested in saying something thought-provoking than violent.

Backed by some fantastic beats, that's what every track on this new album, Section.80, boils down to: Food for thought. Whether the top is street violence, becoming famous, or where his generation is headed, Kendrick always has something substantial to say.

While a few tracks on here sound a little too corny for their own good, Section.80 is still a solid debut from the California kid.

What do you think of this album? Do you love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
