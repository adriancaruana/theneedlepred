Brooklyn's Sleigh Bells break pop's volume barrier with extreme prejudice. The music here is highly compressed, distorted, and manipulated for maximum sonic terror. I like the noise pop approach, but the vocals seem so contrived and boring. Not only that, but there's not much going on in the beats aside from some simple cuts and pastes. I've gotta give it to this album for being one of the loudest records of this year, but that doesn't mean I have to strap on spandex tights and enjoy it.

What do you think of this album? Why is it good? Why is it bad? How would you score it?

3/10
