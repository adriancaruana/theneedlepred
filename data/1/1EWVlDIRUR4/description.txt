The overarching theme on Apocalypse seems clear, but the chapters in this story are kind of vague, making it difficult for me to really get into this album. 

As usual, the instrumentation behind Callahan's deadpan vocals is simple and honest. It serves mostly as a stage for his poetic musings about Drovers, a self-sunk boat, a marriage gone sour, and American values.

Though I wouldn't say anything on this LP is offensively bad, it's definitely not my favorite Callahan album. Enjoyed a few tracks, but not much more.

What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why so? What should I review next, eh?

6/10
