With one stellar instrumental after another from the Alchemist, and a series of rhymes that perfectly fit this album's outlandish exploitation film cover, Rare Chandeliers is easily Bronson's most consistent and impressive project yet.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?
