Rotten Sound's Curse is a loud record. No one can deny that. They have the speedy blast beats, vocals, and guitar riffs every grindcore band should have. However, this LP loses a lot of potential energy in its extremely regulated recording. I know the in-the-moment sound bands like Terrorizer and Napalm Death had is a thing of the past, but even Pig Destroyer is a lot less scheduled than this band. 

The high-gloss finish on this production and the impressive musicianship will make this album entertaining for a lot of people, which is fine. That's just not what I look for in my grindcore, that's all. I'm looking for a group of guys to show me their energy as group, not a studio project.

What do you think of this album? What should I review next, eh?

5/10
