The first track to drop from Mogwai's Hardcore Will Never Die, But You Will is a major success in the band's attempts at a more straightforward sound. The track is easy to swallow, but still holds a lot of drama in its riffs and wall of sound.

The song gets a little repetitive in the melody department, but I still found it highly enjoyable. It's got me excited for what might possibly be a slightly new direction on this upcoming album.

What did you think of this track? Love it? hate it? Why?

8/10
